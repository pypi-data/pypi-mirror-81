Description: **SymSim**
        
        This package is a rudimentary simulation tool based on kinematic scattering of clusters.  While not completely correct this package
        gives basic planar diffraction patterns with some symmetry and allows for rotation (2 and 3-D rotations) as well as allowing for
        disorder (Debye-Waller factor). 
        
        As a result this package should be taken with a grain of salt.  It is interesting for understanding the effects of different symmeteries
        on Angular Correlations, FEM, and other 4-D STEM methods because it is a direct understanding of these effects.  The Kinematics are correct
        assuming that all of the diffraction spots hav an intensity = 1 if they are on he Ewald sphere and they are off the further they get from
        the ideal diffraction case.
        
        Let me know if there are any issues and I will work to fix the mistakes.
