Hi {login},

We received a request to change your password.

Set password link: {base_url}/setpasswd/{set_password_token}

If you didn't request a password change, you can ignore this message
and continue to use your current password. Someone probably typed in
your email address by accident.

In case of any questions, feel free to contact us via our e-mail address: info@cert.pl.

Regards,
