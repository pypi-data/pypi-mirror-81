# daves_utilities

## description
Daves utilities is a collection of function which I repeatedly needed but did not find implemented for python.

## installation
`pip install daves_utilities`

## functions
- for_long  
  adds some useful functionalities for long running loops
  - Save progress and return calculation where you left off
  - Input multiple list to iterate over permutation of all input lists
  - Loading bar
- fun_save  
  Saves the output of any function to a pickle file.
  If the function is run again it will check the input parameters against the saved files. If the input-function combination is found again it will read the pickle file instead of rerunning the function.  
  - This function either saves the last run or every run ever completed.
- is_equal  
  Compare two arbitrary python objects. The function will check recursively in any iterable object.
  - Advantage to a comparison with `X is Y` is that the object does not need to be saved on the same Memory location.
- print_structure
  Print the structure of any iterable python object.
