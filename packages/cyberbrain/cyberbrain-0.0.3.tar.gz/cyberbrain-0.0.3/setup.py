    'long_description': '# Cyberbrain: Python debugging, **redefined**.\n\n[![support-version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/cyberbrain)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/cyberbrain) [![PyPI implementation](https://img.shields.io/pypi/implementation/ansicolortags.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansicolortags/) [![PyPI version shields.io](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cyberbrain.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cyberbrain/)\n\n\n\nCyberbrain is a Python debugging solution aiming to **free programmers**. It visualizes **program execution** and **how each variable changes**.\n\nNever spend hours stepping through a program, let Cyberbrain tell you.\n\n![](docs/images/p1.png)\n\n## Install\n\nCyberbrain consists of a Python library and various editor/IDE integrations. Currently VS Code is the only supported editor, but we have **[plans](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/issues/24)** to expand the support.\n\nTo install Cyberbrain:\n\n```\npip install cyberbrain\ncode --install-extension laike9m.cyberbrain\n```\n\nOr if you prefer, install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cyberbrain/) and [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=laike9m.cyberbrain).\n\n## How to Use\n\nSuppose you want to trace a function called `foo`, just decorate it with `@trace`:\n\n```python\nfrom cyberbrain import trace\n\n@trace  # You can disable tracing with `@trace(disabled=True)`\ndef foo():\n    ...\n```\n\nCyberbrain keeps your workflow unchanged. You run a program (from vscode or command line, both work), call **"Initialize Cyberbrain"** from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), and a new panel will be opened to visualize how your program execution.\n\nThe following gif demonstrates the  workflow:\n\n![](docs/images/usage.gif)\n\nFeatures provided:\n- Dataflow analysis\n- Variable tracing (try hover on any variable, it only highlights **relevant** variables)\n- Object inspection (value is logged in the opened devtools console)\n- Expect more to come 🤟\n\nNote: Cyberbrain may conflict with other debuggers. If you set breakpoints and use VSC\'s debugger, Cyberbrain may not function normally. Generally speaking, **prefer "Run Without Debugging"** (like shown in the gif).\n\n## Status Quo and Milestones\n\n*Updated 2020.9*\n\nCyberbrain is new and under active development, bugs are expected. If you met any, I appreciate if you can [create an issue](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/issues/new). At this point, you should **NOT** use Cyberbrain in production.\n\nMilestones for the project are listed below, which may change over time. Generally speaking, we\'ll release 1.0 when it reaches  "*Production ready*".\n\n| Milestone        | Description                                                           | Status |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Examples ready   | Cyberbrain works on examples (in the `examples/` folder)      | WIP    |\n| Live demo ready  | Cyberbrain can work with code you write in a live demo, in most cases | Not started    |\n| Scripts ready     | Cyberbrain can work with most "scripting" programs                      | Not started    |\n| Announcement ready | Cyberbrain is ready to be shared on Hacker News and Reddit. **Please don\'t broadcast Cyberbrain before it reaches this milestone.**                  | Not started    |\n| Production ready | Cyberbrain can work with most programs in production                  | Not started    |\n\nNote that v1.0 means Cyberbrain is stable in the features it supports, it does **NOT** mean Cyberbrain is feature complete. Major features planned for each future version are listed below. Again, expect it to change at any time.\n\n| Version | Features                        |\n|---------|---------------------------------|\n| 1.0     | Mutual interaction between source code and the trace graph ([#7][m1])  |\n| 2.0     | Multi-frame tracing             |\n| 3.0     | Fine-grained symbol tracing     |\n| 4.0     | Async & multi-threading support |\n\n[m1]: https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/issues/7\n\nVisit the project\'s [kanban](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/projects/1) to learn more about the current development schedule.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin the [Cyberbrain community Discord](https://discord.gg/2TFYtBh) 💬 and follow us on Twitter [@PyCyberbrain](https://twitter.com/PyCyberbrain) 🐦.\n\nAll questions & suggestions & discussions welcomed.\n\n## Interested in Contributing?\nGet started [here](https://github.com/laike9m/Cyberbrain/blob/master/docs/Development.md).\n\n## Support\n\nCyberbrain is a **long-term** project, your support is critical to sustain it. Let\'s make it the best Python debugging tool 🤟!\n\n[![](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/guidelines/download-assets-1.svg)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cyberbrain)\n',
