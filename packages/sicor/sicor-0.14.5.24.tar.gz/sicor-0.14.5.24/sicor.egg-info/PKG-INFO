        Sensor Independent Atmospheric Correction of optical Earth Observation (EO) data from both multispectral and
        hyperspectral instruments. Currently, SICOR can be applied to Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data but the implementation of
        additional space- and airborne sensors is under development. As a unique feature for the processing of hyperspectral
        data, SICOR incorporates a three phases of water retrieval based on Optimal Estimation (OE) including the calculation of
        retrieval uncertainties. The atmospheric modeling in case of hyperspectral data is based on the MODTRAN radiative
        transfer code whereas the atmospheric correction of multispectral data relies on the MOMO code. The MODTRAN trademark is
        being used with the express permission of the owner, Spectral Sciences, Inc. Please check the documentation_ for usage,
        examples and in depth information.

        ------
        
        
        SICOR depends on some open source packages which are usually installed without problems by the automatic install
        routine. However, for some projects, we strongly recommend resolving the dependency before the automatic installer
        is run. This approach avoids problems with conflicting versions of the same software.
        Using conda_, the recommended approach is:
        
         .. code-block:: bash
        
            # create virtual environment for sicor, this is optional
            conda create -y -q -c conda-forge --name sicor python=3
            source activate sicor
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
            conda install --yes -q gdal numpy scikit-image matplotlib pyproj rasterio shapely geopandas pyresample pytables h5py llvmlite pyfftw scikit-learn numba arosics
        
        Install SICOR via pip (recommended):
        
          .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install sicor
        
        Alternatively you can install SICOR by cloning the following repository:
        
         .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://gitext.gfz-potsdam.de/EnMAP/sicor.git
            cd sicor
            python setup.py install
        
        If you like to run SICOR in multispectral mode for Sentinel-2, you need to install the ECMWF API client:
        
         .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install ecmwf-api-client
        
        
        SICOR repository operations can be started using make, available options are:
        
         .. code-block:: console
        
            $ make
        
            make options: (run make [option] to perform action):
        
            clean:
                Remove all build, test, coverage and Python artifacts.
        
            clean-build:
                Remove build artifacts including build/ dist/ and .eggs/ folders.
        
            clean-pyc:
                Remove Python file artifacts, e.g. pyc files.
        
            clean-test:
                Remove test and coverage artifacts.
        
            convert_examples_to_doc:
                Use nbconvert to convert jupyter notebooks in examples to doc/examples.
                Links to internal images are adjusted such that SPHINX documentation
                can be build.
        
            coverage:
                Use coverage to run tests and to produce a coverage report.
        
            coverage_view:
                Open default browser to check coverage report.
        
            docs:
                Generate HTML documentation using SPHINX. If example jupyer notebooks
                should be updated, run the target 'convert_examples_to_doc'
                first.
        
            download-tables (currently, only needed for multispectral case):
                Download tables for atmospheric correction and scene classification
                from google drive if not found locally (anywhere in $PATH). Gdrive
                might be unreliable and fail. Just try again later. Files are
                checked for their hash before continuing here.
        
            download-tables-all (currently, only needed for multispectral case):
                Download ALL tables for atmospheric correction and scene classification.
        
            examples_notebooks:
                Start a jupyter notebook server in the examples directory and
                open browser.
        
            gitlab_CI_docker:
                Build a docker image for CI use within gitlab. This is based
                on docker and required sudo access to docker. Multiple images
                are build, the 'sicor:latest' includes a working environment
                for SICOR and is used to run the tests. SICOR is not included
                in this image and it is cloned and installed for each test run.
        
            install:
                Install the package to the active Python site-packages.
        
            lint:
                Check style and pep8 conformity using multiple pep8 and style
                checkers. Flake8 and pycodestyle need to complete without error
                to not fail here. For now, pylint and pydocstyle are included,
                but their results are ignored. The target 'test' depends on 'lint'
                which means that testing can only be a success when linting was
                run without errors. Run this before any commit!
        
            nose2:
                Run all tests using nose2. Coverage and other plugins are included
                in the ini settings file.
        
            nose2_debug:
                Run a single test using nose2. This is useful for debugging.
                Change this if needed.
        
            requirements:
                Install requirements as defined in requirements.txt using pip.
        
            test:
                Run tests quickly with the default Python interpreter and without
                coverage.
        
            test_single:
                Run a single test quickly with the default Python interpreter and without
                coverage. This is useful for debugging errors and feel free to
                change the considered test case to your liking.
