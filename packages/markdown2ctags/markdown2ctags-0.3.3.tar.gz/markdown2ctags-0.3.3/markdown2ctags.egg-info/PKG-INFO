        **************
        
        This application generates ctags-compatible output for the sections of a
        Markdown document.
        
        The motivation was to have a tool fast enough to use with the
        `TagBar <https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar>`_ plugin in Vim.
        
        Using with TagBar
        =================
        
        To use this tool with TagBar, add the following into your ``~/.vimrc``::
        
            " Add support for markdown files in tagbar.
            let g:tagbar_type_markdown = {
                \ 'ctagstype': 'markdown',
                \ 'ctagsbin' : '/path/to/markdown2ctags.py',
                \ 'ctagsargs' : '-f - --sort=yes --sro=»',
                \ 'kinds' : [
                    \ 's:sections',
                    \ 'i:images'
                \ ],
                \ 'sro' : '»',
                \ 'kind2scope' : {
                    \ 's' : 'section',
                \ },
                \ 'sort': 0,
            \ }
        
        .. note::
        
            The suggested ``sro`` used to be ``|``, but this symbol could be used in
            headings (when talking about logical operators, for example).  As a result,
            I recommend using something like the UTF-8 chevron above and specifying this
            new sro character on the command line via the ``--sro`` option.
        
            However, some folks have had issues with the chevron--TagBar is failing to
            split on the character correctly and it results in incorrect headings that
            contain ``<bb>`` in TagBar.  I'm not sure what the underlying cause is just
            yet, but if you're suffering from this issue, you may want to fall back to
            using the ``|`` character.  You can do this by dropping the ``--sro=»``
            parameter from ``ctagsargs`` and setting ``'sro'`` to ``'|'``.
        
        You'll need to have the TagBar plugin installed for this to work.  Also, you
        may need to call the variable ``g:tagbar_type_mkd`` and change ``ctagstype`` to
        ``'mkd'`` if you're Ben William's Markdown syntax highlighting script.  It sets
        the file type to ``mkd`` whereas Tim Pope's sets it to ``markdown``.
