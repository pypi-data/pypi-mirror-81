Description: # DMI Instagram Scraper
        This package provides a simple GUI on top of 
        [instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io). Instaloader is a great Instagram 
        scraper, but it requires familiarity with command-line interfaces or Python to
        use. For people who do not have that familiarity, this GUI makes it possible to
        scrape Instagram and easily collect all scraped data in a single CSV file with
        metadata.
        
        The scrape runs from the user's own computer. This can be contrasted with tools
        like [4CAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat), which run 
        scrapes from a central server. The disadvantage of that approach is that 
        Instagram's aggressive rate limiting kicks in quickly if many scrapes are run 
        from a central server. By using this app, all scrapes are run from the local 
        computer, hopefully preventing rate limiting from being too obstructive.
        
        CSV files generated by the DMI Instagram Scraper can be imported into 4CAT for
        further analysis.
        
        There is a 
        [FAQ](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-instascraper/wiki/FAQ)
        with some more information on the application.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Via pip
        This is recommended if you have some familiarity with Python, since it makes it
        easier to ensure you are running the latest version of the software.
        
        ```
        pip3 install dmi-instascraper
        ```
        
        Then to run it
        
        ```
        python3 -m dmi_instascraper
        ```
        
        ### Via pre-packaged binaries
        This is the simplest way of running the app; download the application file and 
        run it.
        
        One-file binaries for Windows and macOS are (or will soon be) provided on the 
        [releases](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-instascraper/releases) 
        page.
