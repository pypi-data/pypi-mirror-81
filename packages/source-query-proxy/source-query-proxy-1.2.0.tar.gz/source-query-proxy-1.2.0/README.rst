source-query-proxy
==================

Motivation
----------

Basically Source game-servers works in one thread and can't use more than one core for in-game logic.
For example - CS:GO, CS:Source, Left 4 Dead 2, etc.

Yes, you can use SourceMod to offload calculations (use threading), but we talking about common game logic.
E.g. you can try use `DoS Protection extension <https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2518787&postcount=117>`_, but caching is not fast solution, cause server spent time to receiving and sending answer from cache.

This solution allow redirect some (A2S query) packets to backend and game server don't spent time to answer anymore.
