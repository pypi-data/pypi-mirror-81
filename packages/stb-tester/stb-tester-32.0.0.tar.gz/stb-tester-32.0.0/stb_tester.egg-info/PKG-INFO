        This package contains the "stbt" Python APIs that you can use in test-scripts
        written for running on the [Stb-tester Platform]. The primary purpose of this
        package is to make the stbt library easy to install locally for IDE linting &
        autocompletion.
        
        This package doesn't support video-capture, so `stbt.get_frame()` and
        `stbt.frames()` won't work -- but you will be able to run `stbt.match()` if you
        specify the `frame` parameter explicitly, for example by loading a screenshot
        from disk with `stbt.load_image()`.
        
        This package doesn't include remote-control integrations, so `stbt.press()` and
        similar functions won't work.
        
        This package doesn't bundle the Tesseract OCR engine, so `stbt.ocr()` and
        `stbt.match_text()` won't work.
        
        Premium (non-open source) APIs, such as `stbt.get_rms_volume()` and other
        audio-related APIs, are included as stubs to support IDE linting &
        autocompletion, but without a working implementation.
