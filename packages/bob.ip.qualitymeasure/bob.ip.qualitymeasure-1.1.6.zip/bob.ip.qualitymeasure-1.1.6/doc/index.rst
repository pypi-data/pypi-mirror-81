This package provides functions for extracting image-quality features for still, color images.
Two sets of features are computed: the set of features proposed by Galbally et al.(IEEE TIP 2014),
and the set of features proposed by Wen et al. (IEEE TIFS 2015).
Note that not all features proposed by the authors of the papers are available in this package.
