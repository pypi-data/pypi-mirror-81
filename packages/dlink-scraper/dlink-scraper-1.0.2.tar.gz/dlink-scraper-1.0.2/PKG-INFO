Description: # D-Link Scraper
        ### This is a library that gets information from your D-Link DWR-921 (and possible others) LTE router admin page using web scraping
        
        This package contains 
         - library `dlinkscraper` - which you can use to scrape data from D-Link DWR-921 LTE router 
        (I don't know if it will work on others, I have only this one :P)
         - CLI tool `dlinkscraper` that you can use to get info from console
         - `dlinkscraper-duckdns-update` script, which updates your DuckDNS IP
        (and it's also the reason why I created this package :D)
        
        #### Library usage example
        ```python
        from dlinkscraper import DLink
        dl = DLink('http://192.168.1.1')  # Change this if yours has different IP
        dl.login('admin', <PASSWORD>)
        dl.get_main_site()
        print(dl.isp_name)
        
        # You should always log out if you don't want to get "admin is already logged in" later
        dl.logout()
        ```
        
        #### CLI usage
        Just run `dlinkscraper` from terminal and follow the instructions
        
        #### DuckDNS script usage
        Provide all required variables listed in `--help`. Example:
        ```shell script
        dlinkscraper-duckdns-update --token <YOUR_DUCKDNS_TOKEN> --domain <YOUR_DOMAIN> -p <ROUTER_PASSWORD>
        ```
