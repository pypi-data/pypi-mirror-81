"""
Standardizes multiprocessing use. In the CEA, some functions are run using the standard ``multiprocessing`` library.
They are run by ``map``ing the function to a list of arguments (see ``multiprocessing.Pool.map_async``) and waiting
for the processes to finish, while at the same time piping STDOUT, STDERR through
``cea.utilities.workerstream.QueueWorkerStream`` - this ensures that the dashboard interface can read the output from
the sub-processes.

The way this was done in CEA < v2.23 included boiler plate code that needed to be repeated every time multiprocessing
was used. Issue [#2344](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/CityEnergyAnalyst/issues/2344) was a result of
not applying this technique to the demand script.

This module exports the function `map` which is intended to replace both ``map_async`` and the builtin ``map`` function
(which was used when ``config.multiprocessing == False``). This simplifies multiprocessing.

def vectorize(func, processes=1, on_complete=None):
    """
    Similar to ``numpy.vectorize``, this function wraps ``func`` so that it operates on sequences (of same length)
    of inputs and outputs a sequence of results, similar to ``map(func, *args)``.

    The main point of using ``vectorize`` is to unify single-processing with multi-processing - if processes > 1,
    then multiprocessing is used and the function will be run on a pool of processes. STDOUT and STDERR of these
    processes are fed through a ``cea.workerstream.QueueWorkerStream`` so it can be shown in the dashboard job output.

    The parameter ``on_complete`` is an optional callable that is called for each completed call of ``func``. It takes
    4 arguments:

    - i: the 0-based order in which this call was completed
    - n: the total number of function calls to be made
    - args: the arguments passed to this call to ``func``
    - result: the return value of this call to ``func``

    .. note: due to the way multiprocessing works, ``func`` and ``on_complete`` need to be module-level functions

    .. note: the if processes > 1, then the first argument to the vectorized ``func`` will be converted to a list before
        running. This should not have any side effects, but is necessary if the args are constructed with
        ``itertools.repeat``.

    :param func: The function to vectorize
    :param int processes: The number of processes to use (use ``config.get_number_of_processes()``)
    :param on_complete: An optional function to call for each completed call to ``func``.
