        A Python library for performing common functions on flow cytometry data, 
        such as compensation and transformations.
        
        FlowUtils is part of a suite of Python libraries for analyzing flow c
        ytometry data.  It was developed as an extension to the light-weight 
        [FlowIO library](https://github.com/whitews/FlowIO). FlowIO reads and 
        writes Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files, and has zero dependencies. 
        For higher level interaction with flow cytometry data, including 
        GatingML support, see the related 
        [FlowKit project](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit).
