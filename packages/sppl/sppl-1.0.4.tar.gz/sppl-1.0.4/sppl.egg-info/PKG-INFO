Description: Sum-Product Probabilistic Language
        ==================================
        
        SPPL is a probabilistic programming language that delivers exact inferences
        to a broad range of probabilistic inference queries. SPPL handles
        continuous and discrete distributions, many-to-one numerical
        transformations, and a query language that includes general predicates on
        random variables.
        
        Users express generative models using imperative code with standard
        programming constructs (arrays, if/else, for loops, etc.). This code is
        then translated to a sum-product representation (a of probabilistic
        graphical model that generalizes [sum-product networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01167.pdf))
        that statically represents the probability distribution on all random
        variables in the program and is used as the basis of probabilistic
        inference.
        
        A system description of SPPL is given in:

        ### Installation
        
        This software is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and requires a Python 3.6+
        environment. SPPL is available on PyPI
        
            $ pip install 'sppl'
        
        It may be necessary to install the system-wide dependencies in
        [./requirements.sh](./requirements.sh).
        
        ### Tests
        
        To run the test suite as a user:
        
            $ python -m pytest --pyargs sppl
        
        To run the test suite as a developer:
        
        - To run crash tests:             `$ ./check.sh`
        - To run integration tests:       `$ ./check.sh ci`
        - To run a specific test:         `$ ./check.sh [<pytest-opts>] /path/to/test.py`
        - To run the examples:            `$ ./check.sh examples`
        - To build a docker image:        `$ ./check.sh docker`
        - To generate a coverage report:  `$ ./check.sh coverage`
        
        To view the coverage report, open `htmlcov/index.html` in the browser.
