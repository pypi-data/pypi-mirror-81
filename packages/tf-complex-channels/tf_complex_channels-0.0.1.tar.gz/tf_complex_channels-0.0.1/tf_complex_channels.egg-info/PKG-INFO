Description: # TF Complex Channels
        TF complex channels contains a set of utility tools for working with complex numbers in a channel oriented way.
        
        This approach is proposed and described in [this blog post](https://lukewood.dev/blog/complex-deep-learning).
        
        The primary purpose of this library and approach is to allow the community to push forward with academic research on complex number neural networks without waiting on ml library development.

        ## Basic Usage
        
        ```python
        import tf_complex_channels
        print(x.dtype)
        # > tf.complex64
        print(x.shape)
        # > (1, 2, 3)
        x = complex_to_channels(x)
        print(x.dtype)
        # > tf.float64
        print(x.shape)
        # > (1, 2, 3, 2)
        ```
