# Pykkachu

A convenience library on top of Pykka and PySM to help with common Actor Model patterns.

- Better encapsulate Pykka and PySM so they are not imported by users
- Make Fleet abstract and take a subactor selection algorithm as param
- Unit tests
### Beyond
- Create a config loader for wiring up simple Actors
- Add simple patterns like "Retry" and "When"
