* Minor improvements and cleanup on code and documentation


v0.6.0 (2019-11-02)
===================

* Added `FitReader.last_timestamp` property
* Fixed: `FitReader` was raising `KeyError` instead of `FitParseError` when a
  dev_type was not found
* `FitParseError` message contains more details upon malformed file in some
  cases
* FIT SDK profile upgraded to v21.16

v0.5.0 (2019-04-11)
===================

* Added `fitdecode.DataProcessorBase` class
* ``check_crc`` - the parameter to `fitdecode.FitReader`'s constructor - can now
  be either "enabled", "read-only" or "disabled" (fix #1)
* Minor speed improvements


v0.4.0 (2019-04-10)
===================

* Added `fitdecode.FitDataMessage.has_field`
* `fitdecode.FitDataMessage.get_fields` is now a generator
* `fitdecode.FitDataMessage.get_values` is now a generator
* `fitdecode.DefaultDataProcessor` now converts ``hr.event_timestamp`` values
  that were populated from ``hr.event_timestamp_12`` components to
  `datetime.datetime` objects for convenience
* ``fitjson`` and ``fittxt`` utilities:
  * Added support for input files with Unicode characters
  * Still write output file even if an error occurred while parsing FIT file
* Fixed handling of some FIT fields that are both scaled and components.
  See https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse/issues/84
* Improved support for malformed FIT files.
  See https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse/issues/62
* ``generate_profile`` utility slightly improved
* Added some unit tests
* Minor improvements and corrections

* Completed documentation of `FitDataMessage`
* Improved documentation of `FieldData`
* `FitReader`'s internal state is reset as well after a `FitCRC` has been
  yielded (i.e. not only when a FIT header is about to be read), in order to
  avoid incorrect behavior due to malformed FIT stream


v0.1.0 (2018-07-14)
===================

* Added class property ``frame_type`` (read-only) to `FitHeader`, `FitCRC`,
  `FitDefinitionMessage` and `FitDataMessage` (``records`` module) to ease and
