"""The Loss.

This module and class aim to provide a somewhat useable interface
for the problem of specifying multiple loss functions to compute.

In principle, the canonical way is to provide a list of strings with
names of loss functions. But in practice, we also would like the ability
to use pre-defined collections of lossfs as shortcuts. And sometimes, we
only want to have a single loss, so a list doesn't make sense.

`get_loss` provides an interface to use all of these. The resulting
`Loss` instance then acts as the wrapper to the individual loss functions.
Its arguments are found in a `spec`, from which it can be re-created.

Note that I have declined to use the `config` machinery of `cmlkit` here,
since I think it would be overkill to do so -- the lossfs don't have any
parameters (at least currently). So the `spec` it is, which is just a list
of strings, the same that the constructor would expect.

***

As a user, you should know that typically, when some method in `cmlkit` asks
you for a `loss` argument, you can supply anything that `get_loss` can handle.

If you are instead asked for `lossf`, it needs to be one of the functions in
the `lossf` module.
