Variance                 Percentage of times features which have a variance < 0.01 are excluded. Based on ` sklearn"s VarianceThreshold <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.VarianceThreshold.html/>`_.                                                   
GroupwiseSearch          Randomly select which feature groups to use. Parameters determined by the SelectFeatGroup config part, see below.                                                                                                                                                         
SelectFromModel          Percentage of times features are selected by first training a LASSO model. The alpha for the LASSO model is randomly generated. See also `sklearn"s SelectFromModel <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html/>`_.
UsePCA                   Percentage of times Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to select features.

StatisticalTestMetric    Define the type of statistical test to be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
StatisticalTestThreshold Specify a threshold for the p-value threshold used in the statistical test to select features. The first element defines the lower boundary, the other the upper boundary. Random sampling will occur between the boundaries.
