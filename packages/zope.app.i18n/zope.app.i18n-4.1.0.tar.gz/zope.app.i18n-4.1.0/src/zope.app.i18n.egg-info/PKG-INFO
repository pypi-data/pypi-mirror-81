        Summary
        =======
        
        This package provides placeful persistent translation domains and
        message catalogs along with ZMI views for managing them.
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        Currently this integration does not support the feature of plural messages
        which is supported by the underlying ``zope.i18n`` library. In case you need
        this feature, please discuss this in the issue tracker in the repository.

         CHANGES
        =========
        
        4.1.0 (2020-10-07)
        ==================
        
        - Add compatibility with ``zope.i18n >= 4.7``. We fulfill the interface for
          plural messages now, although we do not provide any implementation. This is
          documented and raises NotImplementedError.
        
        4.0.1 (2019-07-10)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.7.
        
        - Fix deprecation warning about importing IRegistered/IUnregistered from
          their old locations in zope.component.interfaces instead of their current
          locations in zope.interface.interfaces.
        
        4.0.0 (2017-05-25)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy.
        
        - Replace dependency on ``ZODB3`` with ``BTrees`` and ``persistent``.
        
        - Drop test dependency on ``zope.app.testing``.
        
        - The synchronization view now uses Python's built-in transport for
          handling Basic Authentication. As a reminder, Basic Authentication
          does not permit a colon (``:``) in the username, but does allow colons
          in the password (if the server properly conforms to the specification).
        
        3.6.4 (2012-12-14)
        ==================
        
        - Fix translate() when used with ZODB 4.
        - Remove test dependency on zope.app.component
        
        3.6.3 (2010-09-01)
        ==================
        
        - Remove undeclared dependency on zope.deferredimport.
        - Use zope.publisher >= 3.9 instead of zope.app.publisher.
        
        3.6.2 (2009-10-07)
        ==================
        
        - Fix test_translate and follow recent change of HTTPResponse.redirect.
        
        3.6.1 (2009-08-15)
        ==================
        
        - Added a missing testing dependency on zope.app.component.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-03-18)
        ==================
        
        - Some of ZCML configuration was moved into another packages:
        
           * The global INegotiator utility registration was moved into ``zope.i18n``.
           * The include of ``zope.i18n.locales`` was also moved into ``zope.i18n``.
           * The registration of IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages adapter was moved
             into ``zope.app.publisher``.
           * The IAttributeAnnotation implementation statement for HTTPRequest was moved
             into ``zope.publisher`` and will only apply if ``zope.annotation`` is
             available.
           * The IUserPreferredCharsets adapter registration was also moved into
             ``zope.publisher``.
        
        - Depend on zope.component >= 3.6 instead of zope.app.component as the
          ``queryNextUtility`` function was moved there.
        
        - Remove the old ``zope.app.i18n.metadirectives`` module as the directive was
          moved to ``zope.i18n`` ages ago.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
        ==================
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        3.4.6 (2009-01-27)
        ==================
        
        - Fix a simple inconsistent MRO problem in tests
        
        - Substitute zope.app.zapi by direct calls to its wrapped apis. See bug
          219302.
        
        3.4.5 (unreleased)
        ==================
        
        - This was skipped over by accident.

        =================
        
        - Added missing Changes.txt and README.txt files to egg
