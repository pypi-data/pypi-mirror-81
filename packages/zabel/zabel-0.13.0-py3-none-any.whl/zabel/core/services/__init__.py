## Service


class Platform(BaseService):
    """A _Platform_ service.

    A platform is a collection of _services_ with associated _members_,
    _properties_, and _managed projects_.

    This class has no public constructor.  You have to use the
    #::amac.make_platform() factory method to instantiate a _Platform_
    object.

    # Services

    Services are of two kinds: _utilities_, that are not hosting managed
    projects, and _managed services_, that are hosting managed projects.

    Utilities are for example directories or external services (AWS,
     Azure, ...).

    Managed services are typically tools (Artifactory, Jira, ...).

    If no credentials are provided for a service, the service will not
    be instantiated (except if it is defined as being an _anonymous_
    service).

    # Members

    A platform has associated members (members of the managed services
    that are associated to the platform).

    Members have _canonical_ IDs, which are platform-specific.

    Each service must implement the necessary translation methods, to
    and from those canonical IDs from and to their internal IDs.

    Canonical IDs are strings.  Internal IDs are service-specific
    (but typically either strings or integers).

    # Properties

    Properties are data objects attached to a platform.  Those
    properties can be literals (say, a text description) or 'live'
    objects (instances of a class, for example #::Manager or
    #::ManagedDict).

    Properties have a name and a value.  They are singletons.

    Each platform has at least two associated properties,
    `managedprojectdefinitions`, which is an object implementing the
    #::ManagedProjectDefinitionManager interface and `managedaccounts`,
    which is an object implementing the #::ManagedAccountManager
    interface.

    # Managed projects

    Managed projects each have a definition.  Those definitions are
    objects implementing the #::ManagedProjectDefinition interface.

    Managed projects can be 'pushed' to the platform managed services.

    # Managed accounts

    Managed accounts represent the managed projects members, and may
    possibly represent former managed projects members, as well as
    other members (for example, platform administrators, ...).

    Managed accounts can be queried or disabled.

    ## Platform attributes

    In addition to the methods it provides, 3 attributes are exposed:

    | Attribute     | Description                                      |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | `definition`  | A dictionary, the platform definition            |
    | `services`    | A dictionary where keys are service names and
                      values are instances of the specified services   |
