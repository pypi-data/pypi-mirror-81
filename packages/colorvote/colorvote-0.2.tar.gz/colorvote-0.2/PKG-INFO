Description: # Colorvote
        
        Colorvote is a colored coins protocol for voting on the Bitcoin (and compatible
        altcoin) blockchain. It is a modified version of the EPOBC colored coin protocol
        and uses the nSequence field to mark transactions. The protocol requires no
        changes to the blockchain (i.e. soft forks) and has minimal overhead as votes
        are transferred with normal P2PKH transactions. 
        
        This repository contains a detailed protocol specification, a command line
        utility, and a web server.
