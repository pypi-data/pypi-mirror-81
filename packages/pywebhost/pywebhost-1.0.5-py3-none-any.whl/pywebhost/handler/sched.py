    Base Synchronus time/tick - based schduler

    The tasks are ran in whatever thread has called the `tick` function,which means it's thread-safe
    and blocking.

    The delta can be either a `timedelta` object,or a `int`

    `timedelta` is straight-forward:Only execute this function when the time has reached the delta value
    `int` is for executing per `loop`,which is when the `tick` function is called

    e.g.

            sched = BaseScheduler()
            @sched.new(delta=1,run_once=True)
            def run():
                print('Hello,I was ran the first!')
            @sched.new(delta=timedelta(seconds=5),run_once=True)
            def run():
                print('I was executed,and will never be executed again')
            @sched.new(delta=timedelta(seconds=1),run_once=False)
            def run():
                print('...one second has passed!')
            @sched.new(delta=timedelta(seconds=8),run_once=False)
