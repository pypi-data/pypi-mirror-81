Description: logging
        =======
        
        logging is Pycopy's implementation of a subset of CPythons logging module. This
        module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for
        applications and libraries.
        
        Major differences to CPython logging:
        
        * Simplified event propagation, multilevel logger organization is not handled,
          currently there're just 2 levels: root logger and specific named loggers.
        * Filters are not supported.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        At the time of writing, logging requires the `os <https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-os/>`_
        package (installed automatically by the ``upip`` tool).
