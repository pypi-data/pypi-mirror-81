# Madeira

This is a python package which provides wrapper classes for 
Amazon Web Servces (AWS) python deployment SDK (boto3).

## Package name origins

Since the AWS python SDK is called "boto", which refers to Amazon River dolphins,
I figured I'd attempt to follow the pattern and name this after a tributary of the Amazon River,
given that the point of these wrappers is to "deploy into the stream of AWS"... water analogy... get it?
