        A replacement for i3status, written in [Python][python] using [asyncio][asyncio].
        
        Works in both [i3wm][i3wm] and [sway][sway].
        
        For Python 3.6+.
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        Look at the [example.py][example.py] file for inspiration and check the
        [User guide][user-guide] section of documentation.
        
        ## Development
        
        To setup a development environment, create a new [venv][venv] first and run:
        
        ```shell
        make dev-install
        ```
        
        To run the tests, you may run:
        
        ```shell
        make test
        ```
        
        Look at the included `Makefile` for more available commands.
        
        
        If you're using [NixOS][nixos] or nixpkgs, an alternative way to
        get a working environment variable is using the `shell.nix` file included in
        this repo:
        
        ```shell
        nix-shell shell-dev.nix
        ```
        
        For more information, look at [Creating a new block][creating-a-new-block]
        section of documentation.
