Analytic Operating Unit

operating units. Only a user with permissions to operate on the operating
units indicated in an analytic account will have the rights to use it.

  Accounts' and add the accepted Operating Units to each analytic account.

Analytic accounts with no Operating Unit assigned to them will be accessible
by all users with access to analytic accounts.
