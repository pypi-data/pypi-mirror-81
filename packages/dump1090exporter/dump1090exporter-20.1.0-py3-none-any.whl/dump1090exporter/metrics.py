"""
This module defines the metrics that will be exposed to Prometheus.

The metrics are grouped under two top level keys which represent the two data
files that the data is extracted from. Aircraft metrics are extracted from the
data/aircraft.json file. Statistics metrics are extracted from the
data/stats.json file.

Each metric specification item consists of a 3-tuple. The first element
represents a name used within the application to uniquely reference the metric
object. The next two elements represent the Prometheus metric label and its
help string.

When the application creates the actual Prometheus metrics labels it prefixes
`dump1090_` onto each label to namespace the metrics under a common name. In
the case of the stats group of metrics it also adds a `stats_` to the prefix
to group the stats with a common label prefix.

So an item listed under the aircraft section, for example the 'messages_total'
item, will end up with a Prometheus metric label of:

.. code-block:: console

    dump1090_messages_total

An item listed under the stats section, for example the 'stats_messages_total'
item, will end up with a Prometheus metric label of:

.. code-block:: console

    dump1090_stats_messages_total

There are multiple sections in the dump1090 stats data file. The Prometheus
multi-dimensional metrics label are used to expose these. So to obtain the
stats metrics for the last1min group you would use a metrics label of:

.. code-block:: console

    dump1090_stats_messages_total{job="dump1090", time_period="last1min"}

To extract the totals since the dump1090 application started:

.. code-block:: console

    dump1090_stats_messages_total{job="dump1090", time_period="total"}
