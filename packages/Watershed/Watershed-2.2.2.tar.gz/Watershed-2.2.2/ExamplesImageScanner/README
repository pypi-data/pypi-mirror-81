             *****************************************


This directory contains the following scripts:


1)  RunImageScanner.py

           Given a new camera image in which you want to detect small objects,
           the first thing you must do is to run this script (or the next script) 
           to divide the large image into smaller subimages.

           This scripts deposits all the subimages in a directory whose pathname
           you specify in the call to the ImageScanner constructor.    

           This script is non-interactive --- in the sense that it does not let
           you visually examine each subimage before it is written out to the 
           dump directory.


2)  RunImageScannerInteractive.py

           This is the interactive version of the previous script.  Before a
           subimage is written out to the dump directory, you can examine it 
           visually for as long as you want in order to "understand" your 
           data for the presence or the absence of small objects.  

           Note that we are talking about objects that may be so small that
           they may not be clearly visible in the original image if shown
           in the small screen of a typical laptop.

           It is easier to such objects in the subimages since they are shown
           at a scale that is much larger than how they appear in the overall
           original image.

3)  AnalyzeSingleSubimage.py

           After you have created a scanner dump directory of subimages using
           either of the previous two scripts, you can call this script to 
           debug your object detection logic on a single subimage from that
           directory.

           The object detection results produced from a specified subimage
           are shown in the original image to give you a good sense of
           where in the original image you are looking and what the object
           detections look like there.


4)  AnalyzeSingleSubimageShowIntermediateResults.py 

           This script does the same thing as the previous script, except
           that it also shows the intermediate results in the processing of
           the designated subimages.  These intermediate results refer to the
           result of color filtering, binarizing of the data, the output 
           of the connected components operations, etc.
           

5)  AnalyzeScannerDump.py

           Assuming you have perfected your object detection logic, after you
           have created a subimage dump directory with either of the first two
           scripts mentioned above, you can call this script to process ALL
           of the subimages in the dump directory for object detection.


6)  AnalyzeScannerDumpShowIntermediateResults.py
          
           This is an automated version of the previous script.
