        `adapter-transformers` is an extension of [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, integrating adapters into state-of-the-art language models by incorporating **[AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml)**, a central repository for pre-trained adapter modules.
        
        This library can be used as a drop-in replacement for HuggingFace Transformers and regularly synchronizes new upstream changes.
        
        ## Installation
        
        _adapter-transformers_ currently supports **Python 3.6+** and **PyTorch 1.1.0+**.
        After [installing PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), you can install _adapter-transformers_ from PyPI ...
        
        ```
        pip install -U adapter-transformers
        ```
        
        ... or from source by cloning the repository:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git
        cd adapter-transformers
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        HuggingFace's great documentation on getting started with _Transformers_ can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html). _adapter-transformers_ is fully compatible with _Transformers_.
        
        To get started with adapters, refer to these locations:
        
        - **https://docs.adapterhub.ml**, our documentation on training and using adapters with _adapter-transformers_
        - **https://adapterhub.ml** to explore available pre-trained adapter modules and share your own adapters
        - **[Examples folder](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/tree/master/examples)** of this repository containing HuggingFace's example training scripts, many adapted for training adapters
