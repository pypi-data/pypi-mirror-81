"""Stb-tester APIs for logging metrics to Prometheus.

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring & alerting tool.

These APIs offer a similar interface as the official `Prometheus Python
client`_ but the implementation is different: Your test scripts don't need to
start their own HTTP server for Prometheus to query.

This file contains API stubs for local installation, to allow IDE linting &
autocompletion. The real implementation of these APIs is not open-source and it
requires the Stb-tester Node hardware.

    - Number of frames seen with visual glitches or blockiness.
    - Number of VoD assets that failed to play.

    Prometheus is an open-source monitoring & alerting tool. A Prometheus

    Prometheus Histograms are commonly used for performance measurements:

    - Channel zapping time.
    - App launch time.
    - Time for VoD content to start playing.

    Prometheus Histograms allow reporting & alerting on particular quantiles.
    For example you could configure an alert if the 90th percentile of the
    above measurements exceeds a certain threshold (that is, the slowest 10% of
    requests are slower than the threshold).
