  - |
    Drop mongodb support from packstack. Telemetry does not support this
    anymore and there is no reason to keep deploying and maintaining this
    going forward. We will use gnocchi for metrics, panko for events instead.
    Also dropping command options CONFIG_CEILOMETER_METERING_BACKEND and
    CONFIG_CEILOMETER_EVENTS_BACKEND as we directly set the publishers
    in the pipeline.
