Description: # B.CfOutputs
        
        A python based library to list AWS Cloud Formation stack outputs.
        
        #### Description
        
        Sometimes it is very convenient to list all outputs of all stacks
        (especially programmatically). There is no API or SDK command to 
        conveniently do this. Therefore, we have created this library to
        easily get all of the outputs of stacks.
        
        #### Remarks
        
        [Biomapas](https://biomapas.com) aims to modernise life-science 
        industry by sharing its IT knowledge with other companies and 
        the community. This is an open source library intended to be used 
        by anyone. Improvements and pull requests are welcome.

        session = boto3.session.Session('key', 'secret')
        ```
        
        List available Cloud Formation stacks:
        ```python
        from b_cf_outputs.cf_stacks import CfStacks
        stacks = CfStacks(session).get_stacks()
        ```
        
        List outputs from stacks:
        ```python
        from b_cf_outputs.cf_outputs import CfOutputs
        CfOutputs(session).get_outputs()
        ```
        
        #### Testing
