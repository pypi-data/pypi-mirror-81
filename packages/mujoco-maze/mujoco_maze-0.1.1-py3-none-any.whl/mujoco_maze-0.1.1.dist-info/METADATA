Some maze environments for reinforcement learning(RL) using [mujoco-py] and
[openai gym][gym].

Thankfully, this project is based on the code from  [rllab] and [tensorflow/models][models].

## Environments

- PointUMaze/AntUmaze

  ![PointUMaze](./screenshots/PointUMaze.png)
  - PointUMaze-v0/AntUMaze-v0 (Distance-based Reward)
  - PointUmaze-v1/AntUMaze-v1 (Goal-based Reward i.e., 1.0 or -Îµ)

- Point4Rooms/Ant4Rooms

  ![Point4Rooms](./screenshots/Point4Rooms.png)
  - Point4Rooms-v0/Ant4Rooms-v0 (Distance-based Reward)
  - Point4Rooms-v1/Ant4Rooms-v1 (Goal-based Reward)
  - Point4Rooms-v2/Ant4Rooms-v2 (Multiple Goals (0.5 pt or 1.0 pt))

- PointPush/AntPush

## Warning
This project has some other environments (e.g., reacher and swimmer)
but if they are not on README, they are work in progress and
not tested well.
