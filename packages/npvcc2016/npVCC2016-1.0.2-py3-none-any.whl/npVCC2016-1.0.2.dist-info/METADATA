# `npVCC2016` - Python loader of npVCC2016Corpus

`npVCC2016` is a Python loader set for [npVCC2016 non-parallel speech corpus](https://github.com/tarepan/npVCC2016Corpus).  
For machine learning, corpus/dataset is indispensable - but troublesome - part.  
We need portable & flexible loader for streamline development.  
`npVCC2016` is the one!!  

## Demo

Python/PyTorch  

```bash
pip install npVCC2016
```

```python
from npVCC2016.PyTorch.dataset.waveform import NpVCC2016

dataset = NpVCC2016(".", True, True)

for datum in dataset:
    print("Yeah, data is acquired only two line of code!!")
    print(datum)
``` 

`npVCC2016` transparently download corpus, structure the data and provide standarized datasets.  
What you have to do is only importing it!
