REMARK FILENAME="apoa1-ht-box-min.pdb"
REMARK This is a box of 125 water molecules in the experimental
REMARK geometry.  The box was equilibrated previously by Monte Carlo
REMARK for the MCY potential.  It is probably appropiate for starting
REMARK configurations for all 3-site water models.  The box length
REMARK is 15.5516 A and the temperature and density are 300 K and
REMARK 0.0334 A**-3.
