'''
this code is called by SCons to work around a "bug" with the scanner in how it uses the subst() API
The primary issue is that scanner often try to get a list value based variable it wants to expand,
because the subst code at the moment does not allow for an item to expand it no more than one item, it
gets back some string like "foo.a boo.a" not "foo.a" and "boo.a" which means that scanner will fail to find
the item it is scanning for and fail to set a dependancy as needed. Since Parts requires the need for the
subst to posilbly process more than one item, and the currently the scanner tend to subst() each item in
the list seperatly, we "pre expand the values" to allow the scanner to work as expected. This also give us a small
speed boost as we fill in the values as at this point it is not going to change. This prevents extra subst()
processing later on the same environment for the same variable.
