Description:
  "Population p":
    "Pop Detail pd": |
      ## Population Details (pd)
      There are p Populations in the model and each population
      can have d details about them such as their degree of age,
      ethnicity, attitudes and awareness behaviors
    "Protection pm": |
      ## Population to Protection Level (pm)
      For each p Populations falls into which protection
      category m for the burn rates
    "Population Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand for each of n Resources (pn)
      This is the per capita demand for a give population so this is not the per
      capita demand but for every n Resource for ever subpopulation p
    "Pop to Level pl": |
      ## Population's mapped into Summary Levels (pl)
      This maps every population p into any number of summary levels l
      summarized by the l Level level used. In this model higher
      levels mean more protection by convention, but that isn't necessary.
      You can also a given population row spread across different levels
      so that for instance a percentage of a population could go into
      different rows
    "Level Demand ln": |
      ## Population Demand by Summary Level for Resources (ln)
      This is the per capita demand for a set of n resources
      summarized by the l Summary Level used. It provides a view of demand
      aggregated by the summary level.
    "Population Total Demand pn": |
      ## Population Demand Resource pn
      This is the total demand for all p sub-Population for every resource n
    "Level Total Demand ln": |
      ## Total Demand for all Population Summary Levels for Resources (ln)
      For all L population summary levels, the total demand for a set
      of n resources
    "Level Total Cost ln": |
        ## Population Demand Total Cost by N Summary Levels
        For all L population summary levels, the total cost for a set of
        n resources
  "Demand m":
    "Demand Resource mn": |
      ## Protection by Level Demand for Resources aka Burn Rate (mn)
      The burn rates per capita for resources
      For example, 1.18 would mean you need 1.18 N95 masks per day for a
      given population
  "Resource n":
    "Res Attr Data na": |
        ## Resource Attributes Data (na)
        For all n Resources, these are the figures for each of the a Attributes
        of each resource.
    "Pop Level Res Cost ln": |
        ## For Each Summary Level, the cost of Resources
        For each of l summary levels, get the per capita cost for each of n
        Resources.
    "Res Inventory Initial ln": |
        ## Inventory by Population Summary Levels
        For each summarized population level l, this gives for every resource n
        the current inventory of each.
    "Res Inventory EOC ln": |
        ## Economic Order Quantity
        For each summarized population level l, this gives for every resource n
        the economic order quantity for reordering.
    "Res Inventory Min ln": |
        ## Inventory minimum
        For each summarized population level l, this is the minimum inventory
        also known as the safety stock
    "Res Inventory Min in Periods ln": |
        ## Days of Stockpile
        For each summaried population level l, this gives the number of periods
        which are typically days that you have to hold. This is multiplied by
        demand so Inventory Min should be Demand * Days.
    "Res Inventory ln": |
        ## Current Resource Inventory ln
        The current inventory held ready for deliver to Population levels l
        of n resource
