        Features
        --------
        
        * Runs as a daemon and (at a configurable time interval) attempts to send the
          mail in the queue directory.
        * Drop-in replacement for ``msmtp`` in your mutt config.
        * Only attempts to send the queued email message if it can connect to the
          configured SMTP server.
        * When a new email message comes into the queue and you are already online,
          ``offlinemsmtp`` will send it immediately.
        * Integrates with system notifications so that you are notified when mail is
          being sent.
        * Disable/enable sending of mail by the presence/absence of a file. This is
          useful if you want to have some sort of "offline mode".
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using PyPi_::
        
            pip install --user offlinemsmtp
        
        On Arch Linux, you can install the ``offlinemsmtp`` package from the AUR_. For
        example, if you use ``yay``::
        
            yay -S offlinemsmtp
        
        .. _PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/offlinemsmtp/
        .. _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/offlinemsmtp/
        
        Run the daemon using systemd
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Create a file called ``~/.config/systemd/user/offlinemsmtp.service`` with the
        following content (if you installed via the AUR package, a service file was
        already created for you in ``/usr/lib/systemd/user`` so you only need to do this
        step if you want to customize the parameters passed to the daemon)::
        
            [Unit]
            Description=offlinemsmtp
        
            [Service]
            ExecStart=/usr/bin/offlinemsmtp --daemon
        
            [Install]
            WantedBy=default.target
        
        Then, enable and start ``offlinemsmtp`` using systemd::
        
            systemctl --user daemon-reload
            systemctl --user enable --now offlinemsmtp
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``offlinemsmtp`` has two components: a daemon for listening to the outbox folder
        and sending the mail when the network is available and a enqueuer for adding
        mail to the send queue.
        
        To run the daemon in the current command line (this is useful for testing), run
        this command::
        
            offlinemsmtp --daemon
        
        To enqueue emails, use the ``offlinemsmtp`` executable without ``--daemon``. All
        parameters (with a few caveats described below in `Command Line Arguments`_) are
        forwarded on to ``msmtp``. Anything passed in via standard in will be forwarded
        over standard in to ``msmtp`` when the mail is sent.
        
        Configuration with Mutt
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To use offlinemsmtp with mutt, just replace ``msmtp`` in your mutt configuration
        file with ``offlinemsmtp``. Here is an example::
        
            set sendmail = "offlinemsmtp -a personal"
        
        Command Line Arguments
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        offlinemsmtp accepts a number of command line arguments:
        
        - ``-h``, ``--help`` - shows a help message and exits.
        - ``-o DIR``, ``--outbox-directory DIR`` - set the directory to use as the
          outbox. Defaults to ``~/.offlinemsmtp-outbox``.
        - ``-d``, ``--daemon`` - run the offlinemsmtp daemon.
        - ``-s``, ``--silent`` - set to disable all logging and notifications.
        - ``-i INTERVAL``, ``--interval INTERVAL`` - set the interval (in seconds) at
          which to attempt to flush the send queue. Defaults to 60.
        - ``-C FILE``, ``--file FILE`` - the msmtp configuration file to use.
        - ``--send-mail-file FILE`` - only send mail if this file exists (defaults to
          ``None`` meaning that no file is required for mail sending to be enabled)
        - All remaining arguments are passed to ``msmtp``. The ``-C`` argument is
          automatically passed to ``msmtp``.
        - Anything after a special ``--`` argument will be passed to ``msmtp``. This
          allows you to pass arguments that may conflict with ``offlinemsmtp`` arguments
          to ``msmtp``.

        --------------
        
        - https://github.com/marlam/msmtp-mirror/tree/master/scripts/msmtpqueue - this
          is included with ``msmtp``, but doesn't have all of the features that I want.
        - https://github.com/dcbaker/py-mailqueued - looks cool, I didn't see it when I
          was researching, but it's probably better than my implementation, even thought
          I had a lot of fun doing mine.
        - https://github.com/venkytv/msmtp-offline - it's written in Ruby.
