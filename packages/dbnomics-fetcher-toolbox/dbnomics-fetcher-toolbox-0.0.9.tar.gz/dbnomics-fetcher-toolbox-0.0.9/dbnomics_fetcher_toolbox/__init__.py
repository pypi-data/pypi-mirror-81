"""Toolbox of functions and data types helping writing DBnomics fetchers.

The API is organized in sub-modules. They are presented below in alphabetic order.

The API is designed to be convenient to use from a fetcher script,
and avoid making internal details appear in that script.

That's why you will find some functions like
:func:`dbnomics_fetcher_toolbox.logging_utils.setup_logging` taking ``args``
instead of more precise arguments.
