features:
  - In previous releases neutron L3 agent was configured
    statically to manage only br-ex as provider network.
    This way of configuring neutron is being deprecated in neutron
    and it's recomended to move to a new mode where a
    single L3 agent is able to manage multiple provider
    networks. To implement it, a new parameter
    CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_EXTERNAL_PHYSNET has been introduced.
    Default configuration has been modified to preserve the
    same behavior, creating a public network attached to
    br-ex bridge.
