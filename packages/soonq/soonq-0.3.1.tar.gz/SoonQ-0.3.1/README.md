# SoonQ
A subprocess-based task queue.

## Introduction
SoonQ implements a simple FIFO queue using SQLite. It was created primarily for running long simulations.

As of yet, the vision of a subprocess-based workflow has not been realized. However, the package still works as a task queue.

## Installation
`pip install soonq`

## Usage
Users must create their own subclass of `soonq.BaseTask`. Subclasses must define a `run()` method, which contains the business logic for the task (what we care about). Input arguments to this method are restricted to being serializable via the pickle module.

## Running the examples

Example files are included in the examples directory. Clone SoonQ in your desired location...

`C:\desired\location>git clone https://github.com/n8jhj/SoonQ.git`

...and then navigate into the `SoonQ` directory and install it. Be careful to include the dot!

`pip install .`

Now run the following in two separate terminals:

**Terminal 1:**

Run the same script a couple times.

    C:\...\SoonQ>python -m examples timer_task
    Queued task: 913d56e9-a609-4b84-b937-479a94716527

    C:\...\SoonQ>python -m examples timer_task
    Queued task: da952424-98d9-42e1-8851-91a30924b94b

    C:\...\SoonQ>

**Terminal 2:**

    C:\...\SoonQ>python -m examples timer_worker
    Running task: 913d56e9-a609-4b84-b937-479a94716527
    1/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    2/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    3/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    Slept 9 seconds total.
    Finished task: 913d56e9-a609-4b84-b937-479a94716527

    Running task: da952424-98d9-42e1-8851-91a30924b94b
    1/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    2/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    3/3 Sleeping 3 seconds...
    Slept 9 seconds total.
    Finished task: da952424-98d9-42e1-8851-91a30924b94b

    Waiting for next task... (Ctrl + C to quit)

With the worker running, more tasks can be enqueued and will be immediately processed.

Press `Ctrl + C` to quit the worker.

## Etymology
This project is named after my friend Soon-Kyoo, with whom I enjoyed countless bouts of epic ping-pong in college. People call him Q, for short.
