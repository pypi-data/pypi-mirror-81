        Have you been tired of writing similar testing code for your deep learning system?
        Have you asked yourself why I am repeating test example one after another?
        **Shrub** is here for you, a collection of utilities that aims to
        improve your experience of developping deep learning system.
        
        Create tensors, manipulate layouts and data types of them;
        use same model description with layout-aware for different systems;
        manage data for numerous frameworks, or engines, and validate them;
        and son on.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install via `pip install shrub`. *A lot dependency will be installed too, take care of that.*
        
        `shrub.network` is where the `Tensor` and `Model` locates.
        Others are basically runners, try and hack them!
