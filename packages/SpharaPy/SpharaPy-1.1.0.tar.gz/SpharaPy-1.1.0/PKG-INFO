Description: Sphara Implementation in Python
        -------------------------------
        
        SpharaPy is a Python implementation of the new approach for spatial
        harmonic analysis (SPHARA) that extends the classical spatial Fourier
        analysis to non-uniformly positioned samples on an arbitrary surface
        in R^3, see also [graichen2015]. The basis functions used by SPHARA
        are determined by eigenanalysis of the discrete Laplace-Beltrami
        operator defined on a triangular mesh specified by the spatial
        sampling points. The Python toolbox SpharaPy provides classes and
        functions to determine the SPHARA basis functions, to perform data
        analysis and synthesis (SPHARA transform) as well as classes to design
        spatial filters using the SPHARA basis.
        
        Requirements and installation
        -----------------------------
        
        Required software and packages:
        
        - python3 (>=3.6)
        - numpy (>=1.16.1)
        - scipy (>=1.2.0)
        - matplotlib (>=3.0.2)
        
        To install, simply use: ``pip3 install spharapy``
        
        
        Examples and Usage
        ------------------
        
        Minimal examples are contained in the source code of the package. For
