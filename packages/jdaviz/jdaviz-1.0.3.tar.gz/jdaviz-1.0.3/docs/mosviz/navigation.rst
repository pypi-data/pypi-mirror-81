Overview here...

Using the Table Viewer
======================

Clicking on a row in the table viewer populates the other viewers with the data
corresponding to that row. Note that the checkbox at the far left of the row does
not need to be checked to display the data - that checkbox is related to selecting
subsets of rows. By default, 10 rows are shown at a time but this can be changed
with the selector at the bottom right of the table viewer. To the right of the 
rows-per-page selector are left and right arrows that are used to move between
pages of the table, if there is more data than fits on a single page. 

Using the Slit Viewer
=====================

Currently, the option to overlay slit geometry is enabled by default if the 
required information is present. The option to toggle whether slits are displayed
is located in the top right tool menu under the "Slit Overlay" heading, as seen
in the screenshot below.
