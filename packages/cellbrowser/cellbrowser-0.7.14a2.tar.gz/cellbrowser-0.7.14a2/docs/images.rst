Microscopy images
-----------------

The Cell Browser has some basic support for showing microscopy images for your
dataset. The basic model is the one of sets of images (e.g. stainings for 
different markers of the same section) arranged into categories (e.g. stages
or tissues). Some images that can be offered for download-only (e.g. TIFFS) and 
some images can be shown on the screen, these are typically reduced size
versions in JPEG format with sizes of around 1-4k pixels. You provide 
a JSON file with the description of the images. The Cell Browser then
shows an overview of the images on the "Info & Downloads" dialog box.

The default filename is ``images.json`` and has to be placed in the same
directory as the desc.conf file. Here is an example images.json file,
it should be self-explanatory. Contact us if you have questions.
