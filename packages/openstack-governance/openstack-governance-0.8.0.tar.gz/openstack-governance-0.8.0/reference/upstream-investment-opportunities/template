 Investment Opportunity Template
=================================

Summary
-------

Briefly describe the general field in which contributions are sought.

Business Case
-------------

Describe a business case for investment from the point of view of the
organisation paying for the contributions. Readers need a way to identify
whether their organisation is one that would benefit from this specific
upstream investment, so be sure to include that. The business case should also
describe exactly how the investment is expected to save them money, create
additional (monetary) value, reduce business risk, or all of the above.

Technical Details
-----------------

Describe in more detail the nature of the contributions sought, and the
prerequisites that candidates attempting to help should begin with. You should
also describe the nature and extent of the mentoring that is on offer to
anybody who takes the work on.

Contact
-------

List at least one point of contact to help potential contributors get started.
These contacts should be prepared to either act as mentors or find mentors for
interested contributors.
