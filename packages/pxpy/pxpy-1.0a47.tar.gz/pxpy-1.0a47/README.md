pxpy
====
The python library for discrete pairwise undirected graphical models.

Inference:
* Loopy belief propagation (GPU support)
* Junction tree
* Stochastic Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature

Sampling:
* Gibbs Sampling
* Perturb+Map Sampling

Parameter learning:
* Accelerated proximal gradient
* built-in L1 / L2 regularization
* Supports arbitrary custom regularization

Structure learning:
* Chow-Liu trees
* Soft-thresolding
* High-order clique structures

Misc:
* Support for spatio-temporal compressible reparametrization (STRF)
* Runs on x86_64 (linux, windows), ARMv8 (linux), and MSP430 (bare metal)
* Basic graph drawing via graphviz
* Discretization
