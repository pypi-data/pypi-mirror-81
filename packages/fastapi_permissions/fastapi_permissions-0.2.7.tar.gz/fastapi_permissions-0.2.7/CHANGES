----------------------------

 - A quick reminder that this is not dead yet.
 - Added "python-multipart" as a requirement


0.2.6 - OpenAPI Tests, Aug. 2020
--------------------------------

 - Changed the list based ACLs in the example app to catch errors in the test
 - Added tests for the OpenAPI specification of the example app
   This is a reaction to the "List Fix" problems I had and that were finally
   resolved by William.


0.2.5 - List Fix II, Jul. 2020
------------------------------

 - While providing a fix for ACLs as a list, another serious error was
   introduced. Luckily William tried this out and provided a (hopefully)
   final fix.


0.2.4 - List Fix, Jul. 2020
---------------------------

 - When providing ACLs as a list, the permissions are now checked correctly
   (Thanks to William for pointing out this issue)


0.2.2 - Heartbeat, Feb. 2020
----------------------------

 - A quick reminder that this is not dead yet.
 - Added pre-commit hook and isort for imports
 - Some adjustments in the Makefile.


0.2.1 - Depends
---------------

 - wrapping the result of permission_dependency_factory in Depends(),
   simplifying the use in path operation functions


0.2.0 - unpyramidify
--------------------

 - Removing some ideas borrowed from pyramid and some personal preference.


0.1.0  - initial release
------------------------
