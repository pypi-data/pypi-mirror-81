Why Fork?
----------
This is my fork of RLPy.

`RLPy`_ is a great reinforcement learning library with some good features
like custom representations and value function viewers.
However, it is no longer maintained and the PyPI version of RLPy is not
compatible with the latest numpy C-API, which causes runtime errors.

So I decided to fork the repository and provide a maintained version of
RLPy only for Python>=3.6, named RLPy3.
You can download wheels of RLPy3 from `PyPI`_.

.. _RLPy: https://github.com/rlpy/rlpy
.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/rlpy3

In addition, I pushed lots of refactorings, bug fixes, new environments
such as `FixedRewardGridWorld`_, and new algorithms such as `PSRL`_.
I also removed some modules (like parallel-job utilities) to keep this library
maintainable by sufficiently low efforts.

To see what was changed, see the new `CHANGELOG`_.

.. _CHANGELOG: ./CHANGELOG.md
.. _FixedRewardGridWorld: ./rlpy/domains/fixed_reward_grid_world.py
.. _PSRL: ./rlpy/agents/psrl.py

Install
--------
The latest version is 2.0.0b1, which you can install by::

  pip3 install rlpy3 -U --pre


Screenshots
------------

   Value function of the agent.

.. _GridWorld: ./rlpy/domains/GridWorld.py
