This project helps automate some aspects of trading on the World of Warcraft (WoW) auction house.

The program is currently under development and is not currently designed for third party use.

### Requirements

You will need Python 3.7 and World of Warcraft: Classic installed locally on your machine.

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and versioning.

```bash
poetry install
```

You will also need the following WoW Classic Addons installed to interface with the program:

* ArkInventory
* Auctioneer
* Beancounter (comes with Auctioneer)

### Running the script

After the above setup, to run the script enter the following on command line.

```bash
poetry shell
poetry run python run.py -a
```

There are many command line options; -a will run primary analysis (except for sell policies). Please refer to the scripts for further information.

### License
All assets and code are under the MIT LICENSE and in the public domain unless specified otherwise.

#### TODO

* Create additional selling profile for min-bid max-buy high-volume. May require splitting the function more carefully
* More visibility on current inventory
