        ### Authentication
        To be able to use this tool you'll first have to create a calendar that you will
        add the events to.  To create a new google calendar simply click [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings/createcalendar).
        Once you've created the calendar click on the configure button and scroll down
        to the *Integrate Calendar* and copy the Calendar ID.  Now when running
        edumated, when it asks for your calendar id input the one you just copied
        before.
