:term:`computation` graphs for Python * Pandas

.. import-speeds-start
.. tip::
     The module *import-time* dependencies have been carefully optimized so that
     importing all from package takes the minimum time (e.g. *<10ms* in a 2019 laptop)::

        >>> %time from graphtik import *     # doctest: +SKIP
        CPU times: user 8.32 ms, sys: 34 Âµs, total: 8.35 ms
        Wall time: 7.53 ms

     Still, constructing your :term:`pipeline`\\s on import time would take
     considerable more time (e.g. *~300ms* for the 1st pipeline).
     So prefer to construct them in "factory" module functions
     (remember to annotate them with :pep:`typing hints <484>` to denote their retun type).

.. seealso::
    :func:`.plot.active_plotter_plugged()`, :func:`.plot.set_active_plotter()` &
    :func:`.plot.get_active_plotter()` configs, not imported, unless plot is needed.
