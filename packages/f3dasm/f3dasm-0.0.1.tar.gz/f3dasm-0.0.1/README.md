This code intends to facilitate the design and analysis of structures/metamaterials

The main code is called "STEP1_F3DAS.m".
This code includes inputs that should be changed by the user when dealing with a new problem.
The user typically needs to change the "generate_mesh.m" file as well,
to create the parametric geometries of the structure/metamaterial that is simulated by Finite Element Analysis (FEA).

The Bessa research group at TU Delft is small... At the moment, we have limited availability to help future users/developers adapting the code to new problems, but we will do our best to help!
