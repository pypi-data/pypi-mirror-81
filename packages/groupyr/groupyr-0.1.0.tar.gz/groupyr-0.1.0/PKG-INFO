        _groupyr_ is a Python library for penalized regression of grouped covariates.
        This is the _groupyr_ development site. You can view the source code, file new issues, and contribute to _groupyr_'s development. If you just want to learn how to install and use _groupyr_, please look at the [_groupyr_ documentation](https://richford.github.io/groupyr/).
        
        ## Contributing
        
        We love contributions! _groupyr_ is open source, built on open source,
        and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.
        
        We have developed some [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing to
        _groupyr_.

        instructions](https://richford/github.io/groupyr/index.html#citing-groupyr).
        
        ## Acknowledgements
        
        _groupyr_ development is supported through a grant from the [Gordon
        and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/) and from the
        [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) to the [University of
        Washington eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/), as
        well as NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience grant
        R01EB027585-01 through the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and
        Bioengineering to Eleftherios Garyfallidis (Indiana University) and
        Ariel Rokem (University of Washington).
        
        The API design of _groupyr_ was facilitated by the [scikit-learn project
        template](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template) and it
        therefore borrows heavily from
        [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). _groupyr_ relies
        on the [copt optimization library](http://openo.pt/copt/index.html) for its
        solver. The _groupyr_ logo is a flipped silhouette of an [image from J. E.
