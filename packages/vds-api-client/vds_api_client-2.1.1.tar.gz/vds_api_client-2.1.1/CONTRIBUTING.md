## Adding new features/fixing bugs

Before adding any new features please look through the list of issues to see if
there is already an issue tracking your new feature or bug.

If there is no issue yet please create one so we can track the progress. For
more complex new features or bugs it also helps to discuss implementation
plans or bug reproduction steps. 

### Merge requests

If you work on an issue open a merge request as soon as you want. Merge requests
are always against the `develop` branch.

Mark the merge request starting with `WIP:` to make it clear that it is still a work in
progress. Work in progress merge request are a great way to get feedback on your
work before it is all done.

When the merge request is finished please assign the first person in the list of
maintainers. The maintainers will take care of reviewing and merging your
contribution.
