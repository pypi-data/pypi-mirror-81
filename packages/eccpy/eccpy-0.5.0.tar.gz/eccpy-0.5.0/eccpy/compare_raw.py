def compare_rawdata(settings_excel_file, sample_names, **kwargs):
    """ Compare raw dose-response curves between selected samples, for selected experiments.

    Processes the datafiles in settings excel file marked as "TRUE" for "run gatherer."
    Collects output from the "run_curvefit" program, but only for the selected samples.
    Recreates the fitted curves from the four-parameter Hill equation, with the previously calculated hill_constants.

    The output of the compare_rawdata is saved in the same folder as the "run_gatherer":
    ORIGINAL_SUBFOLDER_WITH_SETTINGS_EXCEL_FILE/analysed/todays_date/

    Running this script will overwrite any previous files with the same name (i.e., analysed on the same day)

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings_excel_file : String
        Path to the settings file containing the list of datafiles for analysis, and also chosen parameters
    sample_names : list of strings, or list of tuples
        For the output of one figure comparing the raw data of samples:
            sample_names will be a list of sample names
            e.g. sample_names=["control_sample","sample1", "sample2]"
        For the output of multiple figures comparing the raw data of samples:
            sample_names will be a tuple of lists of of sample names
            e.g. sample_names=(["control_sample","sample1"], ["control_sample","sample2]")
            Note: for many output figures, creating a list_output_fig_names is recommended.
        The strings (e.g. "sample1") must resemble the sample names as written in the original data files,
        rather than shortened names (e.g. "s1") according to the list in the settings file.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    list_output_fig_names : list of strings
        List of output figure names that is used for a multiple analyses, where the sample_names is a list of tuples.
        e.g.
        sample_names=(["control_sample","sample1"], ["control_sample","sample2]", ["sample1","sample2]")
        list_output_fig_names=["control_vs_sample1", "control_vs_sample2", "sample1_vs_sample2"]

    Saved Files and Figures
    -------
    Dose_Response_Curve_Comparison : Scattergram (orig datapoints), line chart (fitted curves)
        Dose-response curves for the selected samples (from sample_names), extracted from the selected experiments
        as labelled "True" in the settings file.
        Each unique sample is given a different colour.
        x-axis : dose units
        y-axis : response units
        scattergram : original datapoints from experiment
        line chart : fitted curve used to calculate EC50, recreated from saved hill_constants

    Note
    -------
    The compare_rawdata function is best used for the comparison of 2-3 samples, with 5-10 experiments.
    It currently can accept 8 different samples.
    Increasing the number of samples or experiments is likely to result in a very cluttered graph.
