## What is pyRANSAC-3D?
**_pyRANSAC-3D_** is an open source implementation of Random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. It fits primitive shapes such as planes, cuboids and cylinder in a point cloud to many aplications: 3D slam, 3D reconstruction, object tracking and many others.

#### Features:
 - Cylinder
 - Plane
 - Cuboid
 - Line


## Installation
Requirements: Numpy

Install with [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyransac3d/):

```sh
pip3 install pyransac3d
```

### Take a look: 

##### Example 1 - Planar RANSAC

``` python
import pyransac3d as pyrsc

points = load_points(.) # Load your point cloud as a numpy array (N, 3)

plane1 = pyrsc.Plane()
best_eq, best_inliers = plane1.fit(points, 0.01)

```

Results in the plane equation Ax+By+Cz+D:
`[1, 0.5, 2, 0]`
