        Introduction
        ============
        
        The package ``ftw.catalogdoctor`` provides healthcheck to find
        inconsistencies in ``portal_catalog`` and surgery to remove some of them. It
        can be run via a ``zopectl.command``.
        
        
        Healthcheck
        ===========
        
        Lists inconsistencies detected in ``portal_catalog``. Finds inconsistencies by
        inspecting the catalog's internal data structures. It currently uses ``paths``
        (the rid-path mapping), ``uids`` (the path-rid mapping), the ``UID`` index and
        catalog metadata to determine if the catalog is healthy or if there are
        problems. Healtcheck is a read-only operation and won't modify the catalog.
        
        It can be run as follows:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ bin/instance doctor healthcheck
        
        
        Surgery
        =======
        
        Attempts to fix issues found by ``healthcheck``. Will do a healtchcheck before
        surgery, then attempt surgery and finally do a post-surgery healthcheck.
        Surgery is a write operation but changes are only committed to the database if
        the post-surgery healtcheck yields no more health problems.
        Currently the set of available surgery is limited to problems we have observed
        in production.
        
        
        It can be run as follows:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ bin/instance doctor surgery
        
        
        There is also a `--dry-run` parameter that prevents committing changes.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ bin/instance doctor --dry-run surgery
        
        
        Debugging
        =========
        
        If you need to debug/analyze issues that ``ftw.catalogdoctor`` cannot fix yet
        have a look at the ``debug`` module. It provides useful functions to ``pprint``
        or inspect catalog state.
