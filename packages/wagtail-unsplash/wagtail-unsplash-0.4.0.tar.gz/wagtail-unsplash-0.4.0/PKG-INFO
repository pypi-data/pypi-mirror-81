        After installing the package, add `wagtail_unsplash` to installed apps in your settings file:

        INSTALLED_APPS = [

            'wagtail_unsplash',
            ...
        ]
        ```
        
        and add the API credentials: 
        
        ```python
        # settings.py
        WAGTAIL_UNSPLASH = {
