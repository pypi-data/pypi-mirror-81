# Many plugins use the certifi package, particularly indirectly through
# the requests package. Certifi can be monkey-patched to not use the
# dedicated CA bundle, which is exactly what we will do. In fact, the
# requests package even suggests to do exactly this:
# https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/certs.py
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ca-certificates
# So, we'll ask it to use SSL_CERT_FILE, one of the most common env vars
# that would contain a path to SSL CA certificate bundle.
# We'll also set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE if it wasn't set already.
