emc2.core (emc2.core)

.. currentmodule:: emc2.core

The procedures in this module contain the core data structures of EMC^2.
In particular, the Instrument class that describes the characteristics
of the instrument to be simulated is stored here. In addition, global
constants used by EMC^2 are also stored in this module.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/

    instruments.KAZR
    instruments.HSRL
    instruments.Ten64nm
    model.ModelE
    model.TestModel
    model.TestConvection

In addition the :func:`emc2.core.quantity` is equivalent to pint's
UnitRegistry().Quantity object. This allows for the use of quantities
with units, making EMC^2 unit aware.
