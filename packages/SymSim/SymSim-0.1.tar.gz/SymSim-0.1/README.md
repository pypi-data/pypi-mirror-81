**SymSim**

This package is a rudimentary simulation tool based on kinematic scattering of clusters.  While not completely correct this package
gives basic planar diffraction patterns with some symmetry and allows for rotation (2 and 3-D rotations) as well as allowing for
disorder (Debye-Waller factor). 

As a result this package should be taken with a grain of salt.  It is interesting for understanding the effects of different symmeteries
on Angular Correlations, FEM, and other 4-D STEM methods because it is a direct understanding of these effects.  The Kinematics are correct
assuming that all of the diffraction spots hav an intensity = 1 if they are on he Ewald sphere and they are off the further they get from
the ideal diffraction case.

Let me know if there are any issues and I will work to fix the mistakes.
