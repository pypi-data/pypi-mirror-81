Description: # pytryfi - Python Interface for TryFi
        This python interface enables you to gather information about your dogs whereabouts, your user details and any bases you may have.
        
        NOTE: Since this interacts with undocumented APIs, this may change without notice.
        
        ## Installation
        TBD
        
        ## Usage
        TryFi uses Graphql for its APIs. Essentially, you will use your username (email address) and password to retrieve a unique username specific for API calls which in turn will be used for the duration to retrieve data.
        
        ### Example
        ```python
        #this will create the object and gather all the necessary data
        tryfi = PyTryFi(username, password)
        print(tryfi)
        
        #this will perform a complete refresh of all Pets and data points
        tryfi.updatePets()
        
        #this will perform a complete refresh of all Bases and data points
        tryfi.updateBases()
        
        #this will just update the last reported location of a bet
        tryfi.updatePetLocation(tryfi.pets[0].petId)
        ```
        
        ## To Do
        * Provide Activity Data History
        * Update Current Activity Data
        * Submit Dog Lost Action
