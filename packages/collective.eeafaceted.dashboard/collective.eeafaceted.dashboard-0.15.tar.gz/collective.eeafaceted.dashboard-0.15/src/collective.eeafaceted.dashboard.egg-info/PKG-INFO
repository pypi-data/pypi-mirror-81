        collective.eeafaceted.dashboard
        ===============================
        
        This package does the glue between :
        
        - `collective.eeafaceted.collectionwidget <https://github.com/collective/collective.eeafaceted.collectionwidget>`_
        - `collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable <https://github.com/collective/collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable>`_
        - `collective.compoundcriterion <https://github.com/collective/collective.compoundcriterion>`_
        - `collective.documentgenerator <https://github.com/collective/collective.documentgenerator>`_
        
        This build a useable eea.facetednavigation based dashboard (works on both Plone 4.3.x and Plone 5.x).  Use the demo profile to easily check what it does :

        Dashboard is essentially made of a faceted widget displaying pre-configured searches, results are displayed in a faceted layout using a table.
        
        The searches filter (collective.eeafaceted.collectionwidget) :
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This filter aims to display "functional and already well thought" searches to users.
        
        - this filter uses the collective.eeafaceted.collectionwidget that is a faceted navigation widget displaying a list of searches stored in current folder;
        - searches stored in folder are elements of type DashboardCollection (based on plone.app.contenttypes Collection) with 3 specific fields "Show number of items in filter?", "Enabled?" and "Condition" (let's Managers enter a TAL expression to define to who this search will be displayed in the collection faceted filter);
        - it is possible to display the count information on a per search basis (here it is enabled for "Elements to review" and "Expired elements" searches);
        - the current page title changes depending on selected search;
        - a default search can be selected so it is executed when user access the dashboard.
        
        The table faceted layout (collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable) :
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        Every faceted layout can be selected to display the dashboard results but collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable add a new faceted layout that displays a z3c.table with sortable columns (using the sort icons in the column header) and a selection column.
        
        - columns may be selected on the defined DashboardCollections so different columns may be displayed for different searches;
        - a "refresh search results" is available so user may refresh the faceted layout without having to reload the entire page;
        - the selection column is useable with collective.documentgenerator or collection.eeafaceted.batchactions for example.
        
        Managing complex searches (collective.compoundcriterion) :
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        
        This package rely on collective.compoundcriterion, it adds a new search criterion called "Filter" for Collections that will let user select a named adapter registered for the ICompoundCriterionFilter.  This adapter returns a catalog query compatible with a Collection query.  This makes it possible to manage complex searches that are not configurable on a Collection using the querywidget.
        
        Document generation (collective.documentgenerator) :
        ----------------------------------------------------
        
        Dashboard integrates the colletive.documentgenerator package that makes it possible to export a dashboard in any format supported by collective.documentgenerator (odt, doc, docx, ods, xls, pdf, ...).  Exportable documents are managed by DashboardPODTemplates added in the dashboard folder.
        
        - it is possible to restrict exportation templates to specific dashboard searches;
        - as for DashboardCollections, it is possible to define a availability condition so document may only be generated by some users.
        
        TODO :
        ------
        - integrate collective.eeafaceted.batchactions when it will work on Plone 5 (integration is already possible on Plone 4).
