renderspec
==========

renderspec is a tool to convert a .spec.j2 Jinja2 template to
a rpm .spec file which is usable for different distributions
and follow their policies and processes.

Documentation for renderspec can be found at

   https://docs.openstack.org/renderspec/latest/

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/renderspec

Developers wishing to work on renderspec should always base
their work on the latest code, available from the master GIT
repository at:

   https://opendev.org/openstack/renderspec
