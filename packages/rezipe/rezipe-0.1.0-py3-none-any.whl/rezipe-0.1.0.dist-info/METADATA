# Recipe 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳🍽
A way to write down your cooking/baking recipes in Python. This is an actual library, no joke (period). Made with ❤ for everyone with minimum coding literacy.

## Features
* Accept concurrent async/await - real home cooker do multiple things at once
* Auto Convertion - enable percise measurement by default
* Easy to fork(searchable, copy and modify) - that is the nature of open source.
* Crystal Clear - yep totally logical and very descriptive


## Roadmap
* Autogen printable recipe/VSCode plugins for assisting read/cli
* Works with your smart home/IoT device
* Auto order/pre-order from your nearby market/farmer
* Auto global ingredient subsitution - how to find nashville hot sauce/butter milk in Udon Thani?
* Auto Nutrition
* Add documentaion/test
* Library of localized ingredients - thanks to inheritance of class, not the all white rice is equal, Not all beef are equal,  `class HomMaliRice(WhiteRice):`, `class Wagyu(Beef)`
* Make this for all popular programing languages
*
* Enable [Bidirection Alias](https://dev.to/circleoncircles/rewrite-link-bidirectional-aliasing-in-python-ekl) for truly world citizen recipe i.e. `dough.bake` == `แป้งโด.อบ` == `面团.烤`

## Style
This will be a modern python lib.
