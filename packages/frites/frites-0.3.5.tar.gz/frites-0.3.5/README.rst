Description
-----------


**FRITES = Framework for Information Theoretical analysis of Electrophysiological data and Statistics**


Frites is a python package for analyzing neurophysiological brain data (i.e M/EEG, sEEG / iEEG / ECoG). The package is entirely based on information theoretic measures (such as mutual information (MI)) in order to perform analysis such as :

* "Correlation like" (**I(c; c)** = MI between two continuous variables)
* "Machine-learning like" (**I(c; d)** = MI between a continuous and a discrete variable)
* "Partial correlation like" (**I(c; c | d)** = MI between two continuous variables and removing the influence of a discrete one)
* Information-transfer about a specific feature

For a comprehensive (and extensive) review, see the paper of Robin AA Ince `A statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis based on mutual information estimated via a gaussian copula <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860095>`_.

Frites also comes with embedded statistics which support fixed and random-effect analysis in combination with inferences either at the single time-point level or at the temporal cluster level.
