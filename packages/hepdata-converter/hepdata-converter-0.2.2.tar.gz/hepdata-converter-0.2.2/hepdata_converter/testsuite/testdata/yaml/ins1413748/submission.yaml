comment: |
  Measurements of the top quark-antiquark ($\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) spin correlations and the top quark polarization are presented for $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ pairs produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\:$TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse-femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed using events with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons) and two or more jets, where at least one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. The spin correlations and polarization are measured from the angular distributions of the two selected leptons, both inclusively and differentially, with respect to the invariant mass, rapidity, and transverse momentum of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system. The measurements are unfolded to the parton level and found to be in agreement with predictions of the standard model. A search for new physics in the form of anomalous top quark chromo moments is performed. No evidence of new physics is observed, and exclusion limits on the real part of the chromo-magnetic dipole moment and the imaginary part of the chromo-electric dipole moment are evaluated.

  For the normalized differential cross sections as a function of the angular variables the distributions are normalized to unit area, i.e. the bin values (and their associated covariances) should be multiplied by the bin widths to give the fraction of events in that bin. For the normalized double-differential cross sections as a function of the angular variables and the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system variables, the quoted bin values (and their associated covariances) are for the fraction of events in that bin, such that the sum of all bin contents is equal to one.

  Bin values are reported to four decimal places, and covariances to four significant figures. Any missing figures are zeros.
