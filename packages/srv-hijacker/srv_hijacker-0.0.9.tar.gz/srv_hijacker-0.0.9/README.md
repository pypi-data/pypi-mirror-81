# srv_hijacker

A python module that patches
[`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) to query a certain DNS
server for SRV records when creating connections.

### Installation

```
pip install srv-hijacker
```

### Usage

This module exposes exactly one function:

```python
import srv_hijacker

srv_hijacker.hijack(
    host_regex=r'service.consul$',
    srv_dns_host='127.0.0.1',
    srv_dns_port=8600,
    libraries_to_patch=['psycopg2']
)
```

Note: Only connections that match the `host_regex` are patched. All other
connections are the same as before.

`srv_dns_host` and `srv_dns_port` are optional, if not provided the default
nameservers and ports configured.

Additionally, A list of supported third party libraries can be given with `libraries_to_patch`
argument. The libraries are patched according to their specific DNS resolution method,
or `PatchError` is raised if the library is not supported.

See `srv_hijacker.PATCHABLE_LIBS` for a list of all supported libraries.

### Running Tests

- Run `make run_consul` to boot up a DNS server to test against
- Run `make test`

### Compatibility

Only confirmed to work with Python 3.7. Tests use `requests`, which uses
`socket` internally.

### Background

The use case this was designed for is to transparently patch `requests` so that
calls to endpoints like `your_service.service.consul` hit consul's DNS server
and use the host + port given in the SRV query.
