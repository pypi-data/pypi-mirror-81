 CHANGELOG
***********

Unreleased
==========

0.6.0
=====

* Validation of field contents have been made stricter: invalid contents
  that were accepted in the past may now cause an indexing error.
* The timestamp field type is now deprecated and expected to contain a
  unix timestamp (a yaml datetime is accepted, but may be converted to a
  unix timestamp) and the types datetime and date have been added.

0.5.1
=====

Library
-------

* This version changes the name of entry IDs from the nonsensical ``uid`` to
  ``eid`` (Entry ID) everywhere in the code, including the property
  ``Entry.uid`` and all method names.
