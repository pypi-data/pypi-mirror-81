# Microtubule dynamics simulation
Simulation of microtubule growth dynamics in the presence and absence of physical obstacles.

Work done by:
- Simulation code: Florian Huber and Maurits Kok
- Experiments run by: Maurits Kok and Svenja-Marei Kalisch
- Marileen Dogterom

## Simulation code
The full simulation code used to produce the results as published in [coming soon] is provided.\ in this repository.  
The code consits of the main simulation code (**simulation_main.py** and **simulation_functions.py**). Simulation parameters are specified in **simulation_parameters.py**. Functions for plotting the results are provided in **plotting_functions.py**.

## Runing the simulation
Jupyter notebook(s) are provided to illustrate how to run the simlation. They can be found in the folder '\notebooks\'.
