Description: ftw.subsite
        ===========
        
        ``ftw.subsite`` provides a ``Subsite`` content type for embedding another website
        within a Plone site.
        It does this by defining it as navigation root.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        For ``ftw.subsite >= 2.6.0``, ``ImageMagick`` is required.
        
        
        Additional functionality provided by `ftw.subsite`
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        - It is possible to define a language on a subsite content, which overrides the
          default behavior of how Plone deals with languages (PloneLanguageTool).
          If you define a language on a subsite all content on and in the
          subsite will be delivered in the chosen language. This functionality
          is not related to the product LinguaPlone.
        
          Make sure you have all languages activated you want, for example:
        
          .. code:: ini
        
              environment-vars =
                  PTS_LANGUAGES de en fr
                  zope_i18n_allowed_languages de en fr
        
        
        - ``ftw.subsite`` has its own language switch viewlet which is based
          on the Subsite configuration. You can connect two or more subsites with
          different languages together by referencing each other with the custom
          reference field on the Subsite.
        
        - The global language attribute is set according to the subsite language. This overrides the plone negotiator. So if you set a language on a document in a susbite and enable content language negotiator, it will have no effect at all. A document in a plone site will still work as expected.
        
        - Custom CSS for a Subsite
        
        - Custom Logo for a Subsite. The logo is registered with a different name `subsite.logo`.
          The setup of `ftw.subsite` hides the default plone logo. You can change this afterwards
          if you like.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        ftw.subsite is compatible with Plone 5.1 and 4.3.
        
        Support for Plone 4.2 has been dropped with the release of ``ftw.subsite`` 2.0.0.
        
        Plone 4.1 support has been dropped due to Plonebugs which interfere with our test setup
        which were fixed in Plone 4.2.  The last Version of ftw.subsite to support Plone 4.1 is 1.3.0.
        
        Plone 4.3
        ---------
        
        Plone 4.3 Dexterity Migration
        
        With ``ftw.subsite`` 2.x only the AT based Subsite content is replaced with a
        Dexterity based Subsite content + ftw.simplelayout default page. Thus the
        Subsite portlet column, column renderer and the teaser portlet are no longer used and will be removed with ``ftw.subsite`` 2.1.0. The ``ftw.subsite`` release 2.0.x will provide a inplace migration. Be aware only static text portlets and subsite teaser portlets will be migrated. You need to provide your own migration for other portlets.
        The subsite_view will be available in ``ftw.subsite`` 2.0.x and removed in 2.1.x.
        
        The Archetypes to Dexterity migration has been rewritten in 2.1.1 and uses the inplace migrator
        introduced in `ftw.upgrade` 2.0.0. The existing upgrade step has been rewritten in order to run
        only when not yet migrated. The migrator is configured to not migrate fields which we had on AT
        but no longer on DX. Instead, those values are backed up in the annotations of the new
        subsite. For projects which add behaviors to the subsite for those old fields, the values can
        be gotten from the annotations and re-set after applying the behavior. This is the responsibility
        of the integration project.
        
        **Note about dependency versions on Plone 4.3:**
        
        Please make sure you are using suitable versions of `plone.app.contenttypes` and `plone.app.event`.
        
        Currently it's recommend to use:
        
        - plone.app.contenttypes 1.1b5: This is the latest 1.x release. 1.2.x is for Plone 5 and does not work.
        - plone.app.event: 1.1.x supports Plone 4.3. Newer releases will require plone.app.widget, which also tries to install Plone 5.
