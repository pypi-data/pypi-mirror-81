    Sorting algorithms:
        These were implemented because the numerical python sort() method
        doesn't work as expected for memory mapped arrays.  It reads the entire
        array into memory to do the sort.

        quicksort(data):
            Run quick sort on an array or list, or something similar with a []
            operator.  Taken from http://hetland.org/coding/python/quicksort.html

        quicksort_keyvalue(keys,values):
            Run quick sort on key value pairs, which should be in lists, arrays or
            something similar with a [] operator.  The sorting is performed on
            the keys. Based on http://hetland.org/coding/python/quicksort.html
