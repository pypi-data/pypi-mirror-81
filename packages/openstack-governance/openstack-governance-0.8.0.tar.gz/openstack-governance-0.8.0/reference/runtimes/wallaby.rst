Python Runtimes for Wallaby
============================

It is the :doc:`policy <../../resolutions/20181024-python-update-process>` that
each OpenStack release cycle will target the latest available version of
Python; default Python runtimes on the distributions listed above; and versions
used in integration tests at the start of the cycle, at least until the point
when all projects have migrated to a later version.

Based on the criteria above, all Python-based projects must target and test
against, at a minimum:

* Python 3.6 (default in CentOS 8.0 and OpenSUSE Leap 15.2)
* Python 3.8 (latest available; default in Ubuntu 20.04)

More details on Python requirements can be found in :ref:`pti-python`.

number of projects within OpenStack using Go, no formal version declaration is
