# `jlcpcbexporter`

Tool to generate BOM and CPL files compatible with JLCPCB's SMT process.

This tool takes an EAGLE CAM export zip file, and generates comma-separated
values (CSV) files that can be uploaded to JLCPCB's web interface to request
SMT treatment for a board.

## Usage

```
$ pip install jlcbpcexporter
$ jlcpcbexporter --layer top eagle-cam-export.zip
```

The `--layer` flag selects between `top` and `bottom` layer, as JLCPCB only
allows SMT on one of the two.

## Compatibility

The tool has been developed with Python 3.8 on Windows, but it should be
compatible with any reasonably modern Python on any operating system.
