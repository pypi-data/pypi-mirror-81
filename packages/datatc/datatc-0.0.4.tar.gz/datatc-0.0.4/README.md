[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/datatc.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/datatc/)

Whhrrrr... Voooooosh... That's the sound of your data coming and going exactly where it belongs

## What is it?
**data traffic control** is a python package that automates every-day interactions with your data files. 
Data files are the building materials we work with *every day, all day*. Working with them should be *effortless*.

## Main Features

* Navigate your data directories with ease, without having to memorize long file paths.
* Load data files without having to think about it (or looking it up the syntax yet again).
* Be certain of how a datafile was generated, and rest easy knowing you could reproduce it. 

## Installation

```
pip install datatc
```
