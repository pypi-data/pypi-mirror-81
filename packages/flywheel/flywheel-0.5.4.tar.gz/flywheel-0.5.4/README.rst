Object mapper for Amazon's DynamoDB

**END OF LIFE WARNING**: I haven't personally used this project, or even written
much python, since early 2014. I will continue to respond to bugs and pull
requests, but I am no longer doing active development. My apologies to those of
you who have come to rely on Flywheel; I wish I had the time to continue it. If
there is anyone in the community interested in becoming the new maintainer and
continuing to move development forward, send me an email and we can discuss.

If you are looking for an alternative, I can recommend `PynamoDB
<https://github.com/jlafon/PynamoDB>`_.

Getting Started
===============
This is what a basic model looks like (schema taken from this `DynamoDB
API documentation
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html>`_)

.. sourcecode:: python

    from flywheel import Model, Field, GlobalIndex

    class GameScore(Model):
        __metadata__ = {
            'global_indexes': [
                GlobalIndex('GameTitleIndex', 'title', 'top_score')
            ],
        }
        userid = Field(hash_key=True)
        title = Field(range_key=True)
        top_score = Field(type=int)
        top_score_time = Field(type=datetime)
        wins = Field(type=int)
        losses = Field(type=int)

        def __init__(self, title, userid):
            self.title = title
            self.userid = userid

Create a new top score

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> score = GameScore('Master Blaster', 'abc')
    >>> score.top_score = 9001
    >>> score.top_score_time = datetime.utcnow()
    >>> engine.sync(score)

Get all top scores for a user

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> scores = engine.query(GameScore).filter(userid='abc').all()

Get the top score for Galaxy Invaders

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> top_score = engine.query(GameScore).filter(title='Galaxy Invaders')\
    ...     .first(desc=True)

Atomically increment a user's "wins" count on Alien Adventure

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> score = GameScore('Alien Adventure', 'abc')
    >>> score.incr_(wins=1)
    >>> engine.sync(score)

Get all scores on Comet Quest that are over 9000

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> scores = engine.query(GameScore).filter(GameScore.top_score > 9000,
    ...                                         title='Comet Quest').all()
