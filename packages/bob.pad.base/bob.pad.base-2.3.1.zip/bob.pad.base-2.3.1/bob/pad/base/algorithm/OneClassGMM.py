class OneClassGMM(Algorithm):

    This class is designed to train a OneClassGMM based PAD system. The OneClassGMM is trained
    using data of one class (real class) only. The procedure is the following:

    1. First, the training data is mean-std normalized using mean and std of the
       real class only.

    2. Second, the OneClassGMM with ``n_components`` Gaussians is trained using samples
       of the real class.

    3. The input features are next classified using pre-trained OneClassGMM machine.

    **Parameters:**

    ``n_components`` : :py:class:`int`
        Number of Gaussians in the OneClassGMM. Default: 1 .

    ``random_state`` : :py:class:`int`
        A seed for the random number generator used in the initialization of
        the OneClassGMM. Default: 3 .

    ``frame_level_scores_flag`` : :py:class:`bool`
        Return scores for each frame individually if True. Otherwise, return a
        single score per video. Default: False.
