<h1>Machine Learning Basics with the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>

<h2>K-Nearest Neighbors</h2><br><br>
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
<br><br>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/672/1*wW8O-0xVQUFhBGexx2B6hg.png">

<br><br>
Notice in the image above that most of the time, similar data points are close to each other. The KNN algorithm hinges on this assumption being true enough for the algorithm to be useful. KNN captures the idea of similarity (sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with some mathematics we might have learned in our childhood— calculating the distance between points on a graph.
<br><br>Note: An understanding of how we calculate the distance between points on a graph is necessary before moving on. If you are unfamiliar with or need a refresher on how this calculation is done, thoroughly read “Distance Between 2 Points” in its entirety, and come right back.
<br><br>There are other ways of calculating distance, and one way might be preferable depending on the problem we are solving. However, the straight-line distance (also called the Euclidean distance) is a popular and familiar choice.
<br><br>
<h2>The KNN Algorithm</h2> <br><br><br><br>
    1. Load the data <br><br>
    2. Initialize K to your chosen number of neighbors <br><br>
    3. For each example in the data <br><br>
        3.1 Calculate the distance between the query example and the current example from the data. <br><br>
        3.2 Add the distance and the index of the example to an ordered collection <br><br>
    4. Sort the ordered collection of distances and indices from smallest to largest (in ascending order) by the distances <br><br>
    5. Pick the first K entries from the sorted collection <br><br>
    6. Get the labels of the selected K entries <br><br>
    7. If regression, return the mean of the K labels <br><br>
    8. If classification, return the mode of the K labels <br><br>
<br><br>
<h2>Choosing the right value for K</h2> <br><br><br><br>
To select the K that’s right for your data, we run the KNN algorithm several times with different values of K and choose the K that reduces the number of errors we encounter while maintaining the algorithm’s ability to accurately make predictions when it’s given data it hasn’t seen before.
<br><br><br><br>Here are some things to keep in mind:
<br><br>    1. As we decrease the value of K to 1, our predictions become less stable. Just think for a minute, imagine K=1 and we have a query point surrounded by several reds and one green (I’m thinking about the top left corner of the colored plot above), but the green is the single nearest neighbor. Reasonably, we would think the query point is most likely red, but because K=1, KNN incorrectly predicts that the query point is green.
<br><br>    2. Inversely, as we increase the value of K, our predictions become more stable due to majority voting / averaging, and thus, more likely to make more accurate predictions (up to a certain point). Eventually, we begin to witness an increasing number of errors. It is at this point we know we have pushed the value of K too far.
<br><br>    3. In cases where we are taking a majority vote (e.g. picking the mode in a classification problem) among labels, we usually make K an odd number to have a tiebreaker.
<br><br><br><br><h2>Advantages</h2><br><br>
<br><br>    1. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
<br><br>    2. There’s no need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions.
<br><br>    3. The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression, and search (as we will see in the next section).
<br><br><br><br><h2>Disadvantages</h2><br><br>
    1. The algorithm gets significantly slower as the number of examples and/or predictors/independent variables increase.

<h1> K-Nearest Neighbors Interview Questions </h1>

<h2> 1. What is “K” in KNN algorithm? </h2>
<p>
K = Number of nearest neighbors you want to select to predict the class of a given item
</p>

<h2> 2. How do we decide the value of "K" in KNN algorithm? </h2>
<p>
If K is small, then results might not be reliable because noise will have a higher influence on the result. If K is large, then there will be a lot of processing which may adversely impact the performance of the algorithm. So, following is must be considered while choosing the value of K:

a. K should be the square root of n (number of data points in training dataset)
b. K should be odd so that there are no ties. If square root is even, then add or subtract 1 to it.
</p>
<h2> 3. Why is the odd value of “K” preferable in KNN algorithm? </h2>
<p>
K should be odd so that there are no ties in the voting. If square root of number of data points is even, then add or subtract 1 to it to make it odd.
</p>
<h2> 4. What is the difference between Euclidean Distance and Manhattan distance? What is the formula of Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance? </h2>
<p>
Both are used to find out the distance between two points. <br><br>

Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance Formula <br><br>

<br><br>
</p>
<h2> 5. Why is KNN algorithm called Lazy Learner? </h2>
<p>
When it gets the training data, it does not learn and make a model, it just stores the data. It does not derive any discriminative function from the training data. It uses the training data when it actually needs to do some prediction. So, KNN does not immediately learn a model, but delays the learning, that is why it is called lazy learner. 
</p>
<h2>  6. Why should we not use KNN algorithm for large datasets? </h2>
<p>
KNN works well with smaller dataset because it is a lazy learner. It needs to store all the data and then makes decision only at run time. It needs to calculate the distance of a given point with all other points. So if dataset is large, there will be a lot of processing which may adversely impact the performance of the algorithm. 

KNN is also very sensitive to noise in the dataset. If the dataset is large, there are chances of noise in the dataset which adversely affect the performance of KNN algorithm.
