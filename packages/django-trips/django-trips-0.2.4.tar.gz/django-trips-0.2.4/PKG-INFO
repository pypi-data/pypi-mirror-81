        ## Develop Django Trips
        Kick the docker build using the following command. 
        ```
        make build
        ``` 
        This task may take few minutes. 
        
         
        Once the build has been completed, spin up the docker and migrate the database. 
        ```bash
        > make run
        > make shell 
        > make update_db
        ```
        Create a superuser with username `admin`.
        
        ``` bash
        > make shell
        > python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
        
        Create batch of trips. Run the following command inside docker shell.
        ```bash
        > python manage.py  generate_trips --batch_size=100
        OR
        > make random_trips
        ```
        
        ## Docker Commands
