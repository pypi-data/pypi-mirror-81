 AT&T Database of Faces
========================

This module contains the interface to query the AT&T database of faces
(formerly known as the ORL face database).

.. warning::

   The AT&T Database of Faces is a small, old and outdated facial image
   database. According to [LiJain2005]_, the *algorithm performance over this
   database has been saturated*. This database should only be used for
   development or testing purposes, and **not** to publish scientific papers
   based on its results!
