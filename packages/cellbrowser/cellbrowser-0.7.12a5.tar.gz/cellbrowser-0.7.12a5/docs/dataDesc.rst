Describing datasets
-------------------

The file ``desc.conf`` is a key-value file, similar to ``cellbrowser.conf``,
but it describes the dataset.

A sample file can be created with the command ``cbBuild --init``.
The tags in the file refer to either HTML files or directly 
contain the relevant text, URL, accession or in rare cases key/value information.

The most important tags are ``title``, ``abstract``, ``methods``, ``unitDesc``, ``image``, 
``pmid``, ``paper_url``, ``lab`` and ``submitter``. All tags are described below and they 
are sorted by content.

These tags contain longer text and can include HTML markup:

- ``title``: title of the dataset, often the paper title
- ``abstract``: a big picture summary of the dataset, as a string
- ``methods``: the methods for the dataset, as a string
- ``unitDesc``: a description of the values / the unit in the expression matrix
  (e.g. 'TPM' or 'log'ed counts')

Instead of long strings with HTML content for ``abstract`` and ``methods``, you can also create the
files ``abstract.html`` and ``methods.html``, they will be used instead. Or use the 
statements ``abstractFile`` and ``methodsFile`` to specify other file names. In the HTML, 
you can use text like ``<section>some subtitle</section>`` to split the text into sections.

These tags contain a file name:

- ``image``: usually a 400px-wide thumbnail of the dimensionality reduction. You can use a command like ``convert graphical_abstract.png -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -resize 400 -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace sRGB thumb.jpg`` to create ``thumb.jpg``, a version of the image only 400 pixels wide that loads faster.
- ``rawMatrixFile``: the file name of the raw unprocessed matrix. Usually a .zip or .gz file. Also see ``rawMatrixNote``.

The following tags can contain URLs and optionally, separated with a space, a label for the link. If you do 
not specify the label, a default label will be used (e.g. 'Biorxiv Preprint'):

- ``biorxiv_url``: URL of the pre-print
- ``paper_url``: URL to any website with the fulltext
- ``other_url``: URL to a website that describes the dataset

The following tags contain accession IDs and will be translated to links (remember that in addition to a string, they can also be a list of strings, in the usual JSON format e.g. ['123', '234']):

- ``pmid``: Pubmed ID of the publication (CIRM TagsV5)
- ``geo_series``: NCBI GEO series ID (CIRM TagsV5)
- ``sra``: NCBI SRA accession
- ``arrayexpress``: EBI Arrayexpress accession
- ``ena_project``: EBI ENA project accession, ENAPxxxx
- ``sra_study``: NCBI SRA SRPxxxx accession
- ``doi``: DOI of paper fulltext
- ``dbgap``: NCBI dbGaP accession, starts with phs
- ``bioproject``: NCBI Bioproject accession, PRJNAxxxx. Can be included with or without the PRJNA prefix.
- ``ega_study``: EGA accession
- ``cirm_dataset``: CIRM CDW dataset name

The following tags contain just text:

- ``submitter``: name and/or email of submitter
- ``lab``: lab and University of submitter
- ``submission_date``: ideally in format year-month-day
- ``rawMatrixNote``: text to describe the raw matrix, see ``rawMatrixFile``
- ``version``: version of dataset, a simple number (1,2,3,...) that should be increased each time a major change (usually meta data) was received from the lab

The following tags contain key-value information::

- ``custom``: anything about the dataset that does not have an existing tag, e.g. {'taxon_id':'9606'}
- ``urls``: any url you want to show, e.g. { 'Raw data on synapse':'https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21560407' }.
- ``algParams``: algorithm parameters, e.g. { 'louvainRes':'0.7' }. This tag is generated by cbScanpy.

The following tags contain a list of key-value information::
- ``supplFiles``: additional files that should be copied and be shown in the 'Download' section, like protocols, Seurat 
  or Scanpy files, e.g. ``supplFiles=[{'file':'seurat3.rds', 'label':'Seurat3 RDS'}]``

The folllowing tags contain only ``True`` or ``False``::

- ``hideDownload=True``: do not show the download instructions.
