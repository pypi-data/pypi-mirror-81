    The default ML2 driver is replaced from ``openvswitch``to ``ovn``. This
    means that, when deploying packstack with the default settings, OVN will

    OVN is now used as the default networking backend for Neutron when
    deploying packstack. Neutron agents such as L2, L3 or DHCP agents are no
    longer used and get replaced by OVN services.
    The encapsulation used will be ``geneve`` instead of ``vxlan``.
