- add checkboxes to legend
- 
- make the horizontal bar between tsne and heatmap look like the bar in Google Slides, with "..." in the middle
- make super long labels shorter by adding "..." in the middle
- Change "cells" to "samples" for treehouse
- convert the heatmap to a dotplot
- add an error message when no quickgenes were defined and the user clicks the heatmap

- Jim: "Open" for collections should show collection, not dataset

urgent:
- colors are not saved anymore!

- intro page upon first start, make tutorial less intrusive
- system to show notes at the top, and never show these again.

immediate:
- remove forceAtlas2 for big datasets in cbScanpy

- make browsers:
  - Dana Peer
  - Tara?
  - Scheuermann?
  - SRA

- when downloading the image, add the legend

- example datasets:
  - pbmc3k -> cbScanpy
  - get the paga sample datasets?

- optimize for firefox: pre-render text onto separate canvas, remove strokeText/fillText
- hint at splitting

datasets:
- ciona Nature PMID30069052

Long-term:
- find genes that follow a gradient (Alex P)

Done:
- make npm65 the default palette
- add md5s of matrix and meta to dataset config
- Datasets:
  - Bob Jones
  - Aparna
  - Tabula Muris
  - Samantha Morris
  - cellranger output  -> cbCellranger
  - Seurat converter as R file -> cbSeurat
- double click to zoom!
- implement mouse overs for label: clear that they're clickable + show acronyms
- sub-datasets
- menu entry for data set info?
- acronyms
- mouse cursor does not change
- format the cluster names as links and make them clickable to show the markers
