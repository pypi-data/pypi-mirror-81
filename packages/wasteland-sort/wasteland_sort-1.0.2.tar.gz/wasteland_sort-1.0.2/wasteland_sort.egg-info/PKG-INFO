        Wasteland sort is an O(m + n) running time sorting algorithm developed with the intention of creating a general purpose O(n) sorting algorithm.
        
        To run the algorithm, call wasteland_sort() and pass in your array to be sorted. The sort is pseudo in-place but unstable. Any element in the array will be replaced. Currently, Wasteland sort only sorts integers, so integer representations of objects can also be sorted, though it won't be very helpful if their hashes aren't unique.
        
        If you have questions about the algorithm, feel free to open an issue and I'll get in contact.
