Description: # libkosciuszko
        
        kosciuszko is a simple vault for storing secrets on GNU/Linux. It is heavily inspired by [encnote](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/encnote).
        
        # Rationale
        
        All existing approaches to storing arbitrary secrets on Linux are shit.
        
        Unsecured secrets are stored in a directory. This directory is then folded into a squashfs, and then encrypted with a GPG key.
        To access secrets, the process is simply reversed.
