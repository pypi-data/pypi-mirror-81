  As same as bloodhound let us reimplement the Java API.
  This is similar to long time ago
  [JavAPI](https://github.com/RealBastie/JavApi) project.

  ### The Idea ###
  Too many good programming languages are looking for developers hype.
  Maybe You believe to coding in all important languages. I want to
  take a good or the best language for my problem. But why the have
  different API interfaces?
  Why it isn't enough only learn the syntax and a little bit semantic?

  ### The Java way ###
  It think it is a good way to take a look into a new programming language
  to reimplement something. Java was great - perhaps Java is great, maybe
  not longer more. I don't no, but I learned Java before the year 2000. So
  I know the old API good enough to reimplement.

  Just like a vampire take the good base of Java, the API declaration and
  **do the hard work: implement the code behind.**

  ### The reason ###
  I like many programming languages or parts of these - Java, C#, Rust, COBOL,
  PHP, Swift,...
  But I like to create a solution for a problem more than using one single
  programming language. And I believe we do not need more programmer, we need
  the right programmer this time. I think with natural language processing
  and the power of computer we can develop with description of problems in
  natural language.

  Python is a programming language with many natural language processing API.
  So I take   Python and Java is the (or with COBOL one of) backend programming
  languages.

  ### API description ###
  If a class and method is defined, take a look to Java API documentation.
