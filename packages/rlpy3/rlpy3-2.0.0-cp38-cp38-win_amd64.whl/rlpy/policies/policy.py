    :py:class:`~rlpy.agents.agent.Agent` will take  given its

    The Agent learns about the :py:class:`~rlpy.domains.domain.Domain`
    as the two interact.
    At each step, the Agent passes information about its current state

    Agent should perform next (see :py:meth:`~rlpy.policies.Policy.Policy.pi`) \n
