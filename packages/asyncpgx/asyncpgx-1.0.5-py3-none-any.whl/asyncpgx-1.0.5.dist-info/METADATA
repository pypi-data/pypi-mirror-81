Extensions for asyncpg.

Based on the [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg) and highly inspired by the [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) package

## Setup
Use `pip install asyncpgx`

## Purpose
This is a thin wrapper on the `asyncpg` package.
Our purpose is to provide convenient extensions to the original package.
We're trying to delegate as much work as we can to the asyncpg (basically our extension methods are high-level proxies to the underlying ones)
and make only converting job.
Original asyncpg API stays the same, you can see it in the [asyncpg documentation](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/).

## Functionality
* queries with named parameters, i.e.
```sql
SELECT field FROM some_table WHERE id <= :id;
```

## Documentation
You can find project documentation [here](https://laukhin.github.io/asyncpgx/index.html)
