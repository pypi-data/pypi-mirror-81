"""Kernel functions as implemented by qmmlpack.

A kernelf function, or kernelf for short is *not* the
same as a kernel in all cases. In `cmlkit` terminology, the
kernel is the whole procedure of computing distances between
two systems. So for global representations, the kernelf is
often the kernel, but when atomic representations are used,
we typically compute a kernel function between these representations
individually and combine the result into an overall kernel.

This is really just a thin translation layer that makes the qmmlpack
callables de/serisalisable in the `cmlkit` way.

There is no getattr magic because it doesn't seem needed.
