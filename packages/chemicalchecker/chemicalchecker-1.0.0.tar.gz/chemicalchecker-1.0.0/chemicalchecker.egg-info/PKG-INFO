Description: The Chemical Checker (CC) is a data-driven resource of small molecule
        bioactivity data. The main goal of the CC is to express data in a format
        that can be used off-the-shelf in daily computational drug discovery
        tasks. The resource is organized in **5 levels** of increasing
        complexity, ranging from the chemical properties of the compounds to
        their clinical outcomes. In between, we consider targets, off-targets,
        perturbed biological networks and several cell-based assays, including
        gene expression, growth inhibition, and morphological profiles. The CC
        is different to other integrative compounds database in almost every
        aspect. The classical, relational representation of the data is
        surpassed here by a less explicit, more machine-learning-friendly
        abstraction of the data
