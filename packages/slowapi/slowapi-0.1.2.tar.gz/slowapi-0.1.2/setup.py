    'long_description': '# SlowApi\n\nA rate limiting library for Starlette and FastAPI adapted from [flask-limiter](http://github.com/alisaifee/flask-limiter).\n\nNote: this is alpha quality code still, the API may change, and things may fall apart while you try it.\n\nThe documentation is on [read the docs](https://slowapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n# Quick start\n\n## Installation\n\n`slowapi` is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/slowapi/) so you can install it as usual:\n\n```\n$ pip install slowapi\n```\n\n# Features\n\nMost feature are coming from (will come from) FlaskLimiter and the underlying [limits](https://limits.readthedocs.io/).\n\nSupported now:\n- Single and multiple `limit` decorator on endpoint functions to apply limits\n- redis, memcached and memory backends to track your limits (memory as a fallback)\n- support for sync and async HTTP endpoints\n- Support for shared limits across a set of routes\n\n\n# Limitations and known issues\n\n  * There is no support for default limits yet (in other words, the only default limit supported is "unlimited")\n\n  * The `request` argument must be explicitly passed to your endpoint, or `slowapi` won\'t be able to hook into it. In other words, write:\n\n```python\n    @limiter.limit("5/minute")\n    async def myendpoint(request: Request)\n        pass\n```\n\nand not:\n\n```python\n    @limiter.limit("5/minute")\n    async def myendpoint()\n        pass\n```\n\n  * `websocket` endpoints are not supported yet.\n\n# Developing and contributing\n\nPRs are more than welcome! Please include tests for your changes :)\n\nThe package uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage dependencies. To setup your dev env:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry install\n```\n\nTo run the tests:\n```bash\n$ pytest\n```\n\n# Credits\n\nCredits go to [flask-limiter](https://github.com/alisaifee/flask-limiter) of which SlowApi is a (still partial) adaptation to Starlette and FastAPI.\nIt\'s also important to mention that the actual rate limiting work is done by [limits](https://github.com/alisaifee/limits/), `slowapi` is just a wrapper around it.\n',
