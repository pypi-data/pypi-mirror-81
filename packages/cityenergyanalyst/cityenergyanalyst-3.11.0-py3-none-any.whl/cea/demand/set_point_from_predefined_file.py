    """
    This function is used to set the space cooling and space heating set points from a predefined hourly set points
    xlsx file. This will help in finding the building demand for a flexible building scenario.

    This script is developed as part of the CONCEPT project (an Intra-CREATE collaboration between FCL and TUM CREATE)

    The excel files with the predefined hourly temperatures are to be stored in
    `scenario\inputs\predefined-hourly-setpoints` folder. This folder in turn has two subfolders namely `space-heating`
    and `space-cooling`. Inside these folders the setpoints are to be provided in an excel file. The excel files need
    to be provided in `BuildingName_temperature.xlsx` format and the necessary columns are `time` and `temperature`

    In case the files are not present, the calculations will still carry on by taking the archetypical set points
    present in CEA databases. Though it will print a message saying `predefined set points file is not provided`
