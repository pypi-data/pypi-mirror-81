# Installation

`hiveplotlib` can be installed via [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/hiveplotlib/):

```
$ pip install hiveplotlib
```

To uninstall, run:

```
$ pip uninstall hiveplotlib
```

# How to Use and Examples

For more on how to use the software, see the
[Basic Usage](https://geomdata.gitlab.io/hiveplotlib/basic_usage.html) doc.

For examples of generating Hive Plots, see our examples with
[Zachary's Karate Club](https://geomdata.gitlab.io/hiveplotlib/karate_club.html) and a
[Bitcoin Trader Trust Network](https://geomdata.gitlab.io/hiveplotlib/bitcoin_user_ratings.html).

All of these examples are available for download as `jupyter` notebooks in the repository under the
[examples](https://gitlab.com/geomdata/hiveplotlib/-/tree/master/examples) directory.

If trying to run the example notebooks, note these are maintained to run in the conda
environment in the repository, specified by `hiveplot_env.yml`.

To install this `conda` environment and associated `jupyter` kernel, clone the repository and run:

```
$ cd <path/to/repository>
$ bash install.sh
```

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank Rodrigo Garcia-Herrera for his work on
[`pyveplot`](https://gitlab.com/rgarcia-herrera/pyveplot), which we referenced
as a starting point for our structural design. We also translated some of his utility
methods for use in this repository.
