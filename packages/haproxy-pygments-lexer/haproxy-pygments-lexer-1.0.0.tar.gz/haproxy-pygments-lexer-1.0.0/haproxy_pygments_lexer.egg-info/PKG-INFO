Description: # Pygments Lexer for the HAProxy configuration syntax
        
        This package enables the latest HAProxy configuration syntax highlighting for
        python [Pygments](https://github.com/pygments/pygments) and is used as the
        basis for the HAProxy lexer on the Pygments project.
        
        The lexer keywords are maintained and updated manually using information from
        the documentation of the HAProxy Community version and the HAProxy Enterprise
        version.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To add the lexer on your already existing pygments installation run:
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        This will install the lexer on your local system and create a python package.
        
        To verify that the lexer is working use the sample HAProxy configuration file.
        
        ```
        # Output the result on your command line
        pygmentize -l haproxy -x haproxy.cfg
        
        # Output the result in an HTML file
        pygmentize -O full -l haproxy -o haproxy.html haproxy.cfg
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        The main grammar rules and keywords are located under `haproxylexer`.
        
        - `_haproxy_builtins.py` contains lists of keywords.
        - `lexer.py` contains all the grammar regexes
        
        To quickly test your changes you can run:
        
        ```
        pygmentize -l ./haproxylexer/lexer.py:HAProxyLexer -x haproxy.cfg
        ```

        ## Thanks and resources
        
        Many thanks for the lovely [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), and [Pygments](https://pygments.org/docs/) documentation.
        
        Also a shout out to [Bojan Marcovic](https://github.com/bmarkovic) for his [vscode-haproxy-syntax](https://github.com/bmarkovic/vscode-haproxy-syntax) and [Alexander Bulimov](https://github.com/abulimov) for his [atom-language-haproxy](https://github.com/abulimov/atom-language-haproxy). Both were a great starting resources and the work done here will be also now easier to port for editors like VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.
        
        ## Funny little disclaimer
        
        The author, has never actually taken the time to learn python...
        
        He just hacked away at this. Please forgive him for any coding "faux passes" he might have done :)
