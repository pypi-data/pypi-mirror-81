Hi {login},

We appreciate that you took the time to apply for MWDB account. Unfortunately, your application did not conform to our Terms of Service ({base_url}/terms/en).

Due to limited resources on our side, we're accepting requests from:
- Independent researchers with documented, public malware research;
- IT security specialists employed in company focused on malware analysis;
- Specialists employed in public IT security institutions (for example national CSIRTs, banks, government institutions etc.);

Unfortunately we're not open for small-business administrators, local ISPs and students without documented malware research.

You can also improve your account request by filling up form with links to your articles and write-ups from analysis.

Also remember that business e-mail is preferable. If you're an independent researcher and want to use private email address,
please confirm your identity with an account related to your research â€“ for example, with a Twitter message to @CERT_Polska_en;

Thank you for interest. In case of any questions, feel free to contact us via our e-mail address: info@cert.pl.

Regards,
CERT.pl
