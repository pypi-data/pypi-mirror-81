**Automated User Interface Testing for Set-Top Boxes & Smart TVs**

Copyright Â© 2018-2020 Stb-tester.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

This package contains the "stbt" Python APIs that you can use in test-scripts
written for running on the [Stb-tester Platform]. The primary purpose of this
package is to make the stbt library easy to install locally for IDE linting &
autocompletion.

This package doesn't support video-capture, so `stbt.get_frame()` and
`stbt.frames()` won't work -- but you will be able to run `stbt.match()` if you
specify the `frame` parameter explicitly, for example by loading a screenshot
from disk with `stbt.load_image()`.

This package doesn't include remote-control integrations, so `stbt.press()` and
similar functions won't work.

This package doesn't bundle the Tesseract OCR engine, so `stbt.ocr()` and
`stbt.match_text()` won't work.

Premium (non-open source) APIs, such as `stbt.get_rms_volume()` and other
audio-related APIs, are included as stubs to support IDE linting &
autocompletion, but without a working implementation.
