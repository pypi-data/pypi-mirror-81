# ElementJob()
#
# A job to run an element's commands. When this job is spawned
# `action_cb` will be called, and when it completes `complete_cb` will
# be called.
#
# Args:
#    scheduler (Scheduler): The scheduler
#    action_name (str): The queue action name
#    max_retries (int): The maximum number of retries
#    action_cb (callable): The function to execute on the child
#    complete_cb (callable): The function to execute when the job completes
#    element (Element): The element to work on
#    kwargs: Remaining Job() constructor arguments
#
# Here is the calling signature of the action_cb:
#
#     action_cb():
#
#     This function will be called in the child task
#
#     Args:
#        element (Element): The element passed to the Job() constructor
#
#     Returns:
#        (object): Any abstract simple python object, including a string, int,
#                  bool, list or dict, this must be a simple serializable object.
#
# Here is the calling signature of the complete_cb:
#
#     complete_cb():
#
#     This function will be called when the child task completes
#
#     Args:
#        job (Job): The job object which completed
#        element (Element): The element passed to the Job() constructor
#        status (JobStatus): The status of whether the workload raised an exception
#        result (object): The deserialized object returned by the `action_cb`, or None
#                         if `success` is False
