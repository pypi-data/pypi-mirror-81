We monkey-patch SCons.Script.Main.main() to output debug time even if the build failed for some
obscure exception - it's not clear why SCons wanted to hide this statistics in such a case.

To detect if SCons has already printed the info we also monkey-patch
SCons.Debug.dump_caller_counts which is only called by main() right before printint the stats
