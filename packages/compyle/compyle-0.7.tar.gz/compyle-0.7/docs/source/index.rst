Welcome to Compyle's documentation!
===================================

Compyle allows users to execute a restricted subset of Python (almost similar
to C) on a variety of HPC platforms. Currently we support multi-core CPU
execution using Cython, and support GPU devices using OpenCL and CUDA.

You can try Compyle online on a `Google Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGRiArYXV1LEkZtUeg9j0qQ21MDqQR2U?usp=sharing>`_.
