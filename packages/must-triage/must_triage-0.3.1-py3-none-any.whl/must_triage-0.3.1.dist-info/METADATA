# must-triage
When things go wrong with [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) or [OpenShift Container Storage](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-storage/), we sometimes use [`must-gather`](https://github.com/openshift/must-gather) or [`ocs-must-gather`](https://github.com/openshift/ocs-operator/tree/master/must-gather) to collect logfiles and other documents to diagnose issues. While those tools are useful in that they can show us a lot about the state of the system(s), they don't offer anything to help process that information.

`must-triage` is a very small utility to aid in identifying problems recorded in `must-gather` output.

## Features
Currently, `must-triage` knows about the following potential issues:

### OpenShift (OCP)
- Unparseable YAML files
- Pods not in ready state
- Operators who haven't reported success
- YAML files which contain a top-level error field

### OpenShift Container Storage (OCS)
- Empty JSON files
- Unparseable JSON files
- Ceph health not `HEALTH_OK`
- Logfiles which mention a panic

Teaching it to identify new issues is not difficult; PRs warmly welcomed!

## Installation
```
pip install must-triage
```

## Usage
```
must-triage /path/to/must-gather/output
```
