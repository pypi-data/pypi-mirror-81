        GRAPPA is a popular parallel imaging reconstruction algorithm.
        Unfortunately there aren't a lot of easy to use Python
        implementations of it or its many variants available, so I decided to
        release this simple package.
        
        There are also a couple reference SENSE-like implementations that
        have made their way into the package.  This is to be expected -- a
        lot of later parallel imaging algorithms have hints of both GRAPPA-
        and SENSE-like inspirations.
        
        Installation should be quick:
        
        .. code-block::
        
           pip install pygrappa
