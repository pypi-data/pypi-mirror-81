    Now packstack support using Open Virtual Network (ovn) as neutron
    plugin. To enable it you need to set CONFIG_NEUTRON_L2_AGENT to ovn.
    Additionally some options have been added to configure different options
    and topologies:

        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS
        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_IFACES
        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGES_COMPUTE
        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_EXTERNAL_PHYSNET
        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_TUNNEL_IF
        * CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_TUNNEL_SUBNETS

    Additionally, geneve has been included as an option to existing parameters
    CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS and CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TENANT_NETWORK_TYPES.
    Note that OVN networking has still some limitations, as lack of support of
    for LBaaS, FWaaS and VPNaaS. Consult networking-ovn documentation for
    further details.
