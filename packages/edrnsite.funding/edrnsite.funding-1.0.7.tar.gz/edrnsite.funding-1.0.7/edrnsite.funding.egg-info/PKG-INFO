        This product, ``edrnsite.funding``, provides content types for Plone_ 3 (or
        later) to announce, search, discover, and manage funding opportunities of the
        Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_).  Although intended for the EDRN
        public portal, it can be installed in any Plone-compatible site.
        
        It was developed by the Informatics Center (IC_), operated by JPL_.
