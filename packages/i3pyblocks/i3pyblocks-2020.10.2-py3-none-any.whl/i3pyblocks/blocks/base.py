    """Base Block.

    A Block represents each part that composes an i3pyblocks output. It is
    responsible extracting, parsing and processing the information, and also
    formatting so it can be output in i3bar later.

    This is an abstract class defining the interface for what a Block is.
    It should not be used directly, instead it should be derivated and its
    abstract methods should be implemented.

    :param block_name: Allows you to set a custom internal representation for
        the class. This should only be useful if you need to differentiate
        between multiple instances of the same module in a consistent way
        (i.e.: you can't rely on something random like the :attr:`id`).
        If not passed this will use by default the string representation of
        the class name.

    :param default_state: Defines the default state of the Block, that is, the
        value that will be shown unless the state is updated by
        :meth:`update_state()` method. For example, let's say you want a block
        that has a permanent green background (unless overriden), so you can do
        something like::

            block_instance = Block(
                default_state={
                    "background": "#008000",
                },
            )

        And all calls to :meth:`result()` will have ``background == "#008000"``,
        unless overriden by :meth:`update_state()` with a different value.

    :ivar id: Unique identifier for Block based on UUIDv4.

    :cvar ex_format: Reference of :class:`~i3pyblocks.formatter.ExtendedFormatter`'s
        ``format()`` method available to all children. Supports some additional
        funcionality compared to the default ``str().format()`` method, for
        example::

            s = "HellO WorlD!"
            print(self.ex_format("{!u}", s))  # "HELLO WORLD!"
            print(self.ex_format("{!l}", s))  # "hello world!"
            print(self.ex_format("{!c}", s))  # "Hello world!"
            print(self.ex_format("{!t}", s))  # "Hello World!"

        The state is what will be shown by the Block in the next update,
        unless another update occurs before a Block's :meth:`push_update`
        method is called.

        Each of this method arguments is from `blocks in i3bar protocol`_,
        since they're mapped directly from it (so a ``full_text="foo"`` results
        in a ``{"full_text": "foo"}`` in the Block's output).

        :param full_text: The full_text will be displayed by i3bar on the status
            line. This is the only required parameter. If full_text is an empty
            string, the block will be skipped.

        :param short_text: It will be used in case the status line needs to be
            shortened because it uses more space than your screen provides.

        :param color: To make the current state of the information easy to spot,
            colors can be used. Colors are specified in hex (like in HTML),
            starting with a leading hash sign. For example, #ff0000 means red.

        :param background: Overrides the background color for this particular
            block.

        :param border: Overrides the border color for this particular block.

        :param border_top: Defines the width (in pixels) of the top border of
            this block. Defaults to 1.

        :param border_right: Defines the width (in pixels) of the right border
            of this block. Defaults to 1.

        :param border_bottom: Defines the width (in pixels) of the bottom border
            of this block. Defaults to 1.

        :param border_left: Defines the width (in pixels) of the left border of
            this block. Defaults to 1.

        :param min_width: The minimum width (in pixels) of the block. If the
            content of the full_text key take less space than the specified
            min_width, the block will be padded to the left and/or the right
            side, according to the align key.

        :param align: Align text on the center, right or left (default) of the
            block, when the minimum width of the latter, specified by the
            min_width key, is not reached.

        :param urgent: A boolean which specifies whether the current value is
            urgent.

        :param separator: A boolean which specifies whether a separator line
            should be drawn after this block. The default is true, meaning the
            separator line will be drawn.

        :param separator_block_width: The amount of pixels to leave blank after
            the block. In the middle of this gap, a separator line will be
            drawn unless separator is disabled.

        :param markup: A string that indicates how the text of the block should
            be parsed. Pango markup only works if you use a pango font.
