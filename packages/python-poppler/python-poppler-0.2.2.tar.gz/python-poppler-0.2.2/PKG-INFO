        # python-poppler
        
        **python-poppler** is a Python binding to the poppler-cpp library. It allows to read, render, or modify PDF documents.
        More specifically, it currently allows to:
        - read an modify document meta data;
        - list and read embedded documents;
        - list the fonts used by the document;
        - search or extract text on a given page of the document;
        - render a page to a raw image;
        - get info about transitions effects between the pages;
        - read the table of contents of the document.
        
        
        # Documentation
        
        https://cbrunet.github.io/python-poppler/
        
        Documentation is currently a work-in-progress. Here you will find information about
        installation of the package, compilation from sources, and usage.
        
        Meanwhile, because it follows the interface of `poppler-cpp`, you can refer to the [documentation of the C++ library](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/api/cpp/namespacepoppler.html).
        
        
        
        # Usage
        
        The package is installed as `poppler`. 
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from poppler import load_from_file, PageRenderer
        
        pdf_document = load_from_file("sample.pdf")
        page_1 = pdf_document.create_page(0)
        page_1_text = page_1.text()
        
        renderer = PageRenderer()
        image = renderer.render_page(page_1)
        image_data = image.data
        ```
