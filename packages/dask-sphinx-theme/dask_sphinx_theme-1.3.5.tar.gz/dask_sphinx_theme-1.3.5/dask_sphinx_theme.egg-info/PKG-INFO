Description: Dask Sphinx Theme
        =================
        
        This is the official Sphinx theme for Dask documentation.  It extends the
        ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` project, but adds custom styling and a navigation bar to
        additional Dask subprojects.
        
        When creating a Dask subproject you can include this theme by changing this
        line in your conf.py file
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           html_theme = 'dask_sphinx_theme'
        
        And by including ``dask_sphinx_theme`` as a requirement in your documentation
        installation.
