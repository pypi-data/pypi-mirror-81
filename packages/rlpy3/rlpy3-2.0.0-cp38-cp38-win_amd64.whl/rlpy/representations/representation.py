    """
    The Representation is the :py:class:`~rlpy.agents.agent.Agent`'s model of the
    value function associated with a :py:class:`~rlpy.domains.domain.Domain`.

    As the Agent interacts with the Domain, it receives updates in the form of
    state, action, reward, next state, next action. \n
    The Agent passes these quantities to its Representation, which is
    responsible for maintaining the value function usually in some
    lower-dimensional feature space.
    agents can later query the Representation for the value of being in a state
    *V(s)* or the value of taking an action in a particular state
    ( known as the Q-function, *Q(s,a)* ).

    .. note::
        Throughout the framework, ``phi`` refers to the vector of features;
        ``phi`` or ``phi_s`` is thus the vector of feature functions evaluated
        at the state *s*.  phi_s_a appends ``|A| - 1`` copies of ``phi_s``, such
        that ``|phi_s_a| = |A| * |phi|``, where ``|A| is the size of the action
        space and ``phi`` is the number of features.  Each of these blocks
        corresponds to a state-action pair; all blocks except for the selected
        action ``a`` are set to 0.

    The Representation class is a base class that provides the basic framework
    for all representations. It provides the methods and attributes
    that allow child classes to interact with the Agent and Domain classes
    within the RLPy library. \n
    All new representation implementations should inherit from this class.

    .. note::
        At present, it is assumed that the Linear Function approximator
        family of representations is being used.
