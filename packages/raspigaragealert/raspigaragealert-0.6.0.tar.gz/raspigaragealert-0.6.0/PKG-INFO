Description: Currently incredibly alpha code, but I wanted to make sure I could publish starting early.
        
        Generate an alert when your garage door is left open
        
        I was inspired by the work done by this guy: https://github.com/rllynch/pi_garage_alert, but I wanted to make pretty drastic changes and I thought it would be rude to so radically change someone's code in a fork.
        
        The exact magnetic sensor he used was unavailable, so I bought a similar model, SM-226L-3Q. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005H3GCW0).
        
        On that model, if you connect it with the red wire, it goes high (1) if the garage is closed and low (0) if open.
