Description: UBC Peer Instruction Tool for edX
        =================================
        
        |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
        
        **Note: This is a work in progress**
        
        Over the last 20 years, Peer Instruction has become a widely-adopted
        instructional technique across higher education. It is the cornerstone
        of a range of approaches that collectively aim to use classroom time
        (usually lectures) more productively than simply as a vehicle for
        didactic presentation of content. Such approaches often broadly
        classified as ‘interactive engagement’ strategies, or — more recently —
        ‘flipped classroom’ approaches.
        
        The learning and retention benefits of interactive engagement strategies
        has been convincingly demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis by Freeman
        et al which examined 225 published studies across various STEM
        disciplines and course contexts. Relating directly to peer instruction,
        and specifically the efficacy of peer discussion to improve student
        performance on concept questions posed in class, a 2009 study by Smith
        et al (Science 323, 122 (2009)) demonstrates this effect comes from
        enhanced learning, rather than simply peer influence. The impact peer
        instruction has had was recognized through the award of the inaugural
        Minerva prize for enhancement in higher education to Eric Mazur in 2014.
        
        One of the key features in the success of peer instruction in enhancing
        student learning is to promote higher-order cognitive activities
        (articulation, evaluation, synthesis etc.) within a learning sequence or
        activity (for example, within a lecture segment in the face-to-face
        environment). It is specifically this benefit that we seek to replicate
        and expose within the online environment through this suggestion to
        develop online Peer Instruction (oPI) in the functionality within edX.
        To that effect, we have created the Peer Instruction Tool.
        
        Basic workflow
        --------------
        
        1. In Studio, course creator creates a new advanced problem of type Peer
           Instruction, configures and publishes
        2. In the LMS, (following some content presentation) the student is
           presented the question, answer options and text box to complete their
           rationale for their answer.
        3. Following submit, the student is presented with a range of
           alternative student answers and rationales (This is as an alternative
           to small group discussion)
        4. Students reflect on the answers presented, then modify their own
           answer and rationale and submit a final answer
        5. Students are presented feedback including their own answer, the model
           instructor answer and class distribution statistics across both
           stages.
        6. The Instructor is able to see class statistics on demand at any given
           time in process.
        
        Installing Dependencies and this XBlock
        ---------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
           cd PATH/TO/SOURCE
           make deps
           pip install -e .
        
        Update Lanaguage Files
        ----------------------
        
        Extract Strings
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
           make extract
        
        Then upload ``ubcpi/translations/en/LC_MESSAGES/text.po`` to transifex
        for translation. Once translation is complete, download the translated
        files and compile them into .mo files.
        
        Compile Translation Files
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
           make compile
        
        Running in WorkBench
        --------------------
        
        ::
        
           make workbench
        
        Running Unit Tests
        ------------------
        
        ::
        
           make test
        
        or
        
        ::
        
           make test-py
           make test-js
        
        Running Acceptance Tests
        ------------------------
        
        To run acceptance test, the devstack has to be running at localhost:8000
        and localhost:8001 (configurable in protractor.conf) with auth auth
        enabled. To enable auto auth under FEATURE section in cms.env.json and
        lms.env.json from Edx platform:
        
        ::
        
           AUTOMATIC_AUTH_FOR_TESTING: true
        
        (Optional) Disable Django debug toolbar and contracts for faster tests:
        https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Developing-on-the-edX-Developer-Stack#making-the-local-servers-run-faster
        
        Install webdriver:
        
        ::
        
           node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update --standalone
        
        Run tests:
        
        ::
        
           make test-acceptance
        
        Single test:
        
        ::
        
           node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor protractor.conf.js --browser chrome --specs=ubcpi/static/js/features/cms.feature
        
        Deploy UBCPI to upstream edx
        ----------------------------
        
        In order for the upstream edx to include a new version of UBCPI, modify
        the file
        `main.yml <https://github.com/edx/configuration/tree/master/playbooks/roles/edxapp/defaults>`__
        and submit a pull request to that repository.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. Added the ‘random’ algorithm which allows a student to see a
           completely random selection of others’ answers
        2. Added and edited front-end help documentation so that it’s more clear
           what each step is and what will happen at the next step and, if
           appropriate, why you can’t progress to the next step
        3. Added a first-pass at hooking up UBCPI to the edX grading system.
           This is more of a ‘completion’ mark as a student is always given the
           grade after they submit their revised answer regardless of the
           responses being correct or not
        4. Tidying up of the statistics graphs that are shown on the last step

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. The edit window in studio is now much tidier and contains much more
           useful hints
        2. Fixed the bug where a rationale wasn’t required
        3. Tidied up the bar charts display for the LMS view and made the
           correct answer show more prominantly
        4. Default content is now somewhat more useful
        5. Rationales now can have a minimum an/or maximum character count
        
        .. _section-13:
        
        0.1.0
        ~~~~~
        
        1. Incredibly basic proof of concept working
        2. Can add questions and possible responses
        3. Students can answer, view others’ responses (with seeds if necessary)
        4. Analytics in the form of charts of initial and final responses
