      Run the ATC checking to show if the current ATCs are still valid.
      Foundation membership can change anytime, and we don't want our linter
      jobs to fail due to this, but we want to be informed at all times.

      Run a job to validate the legacy.yaml file to ensure that projects are
      properly retired.  This job only runs on legacy.yaml changes to ensure
      that we don't hit OpenDev.org with too many requests without changes.
