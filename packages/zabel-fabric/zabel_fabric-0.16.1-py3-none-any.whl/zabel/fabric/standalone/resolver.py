"""
This module implements a thread-specific DNS resolver.

The DNS resolver performs the translation from one `name`:`port` pair to
another `targetname`:`targetPort` pair.  The translation is
thread-specific.

`name` and `targetname` can be IP addresses (but does not have to).

DNS requests performed using the **requests** library (or any other
python library that rely on the **socket** library) will be passed
to the specified resolver.
