musdl (**mus**score **d**own**l**oader) is a downloader for Musescore, written in Python.
musdl can download scores as MP3, MIDI, MXL and PDF.
PDFs are rendered from individual SVGs to A4 size using [svglib](https://pypi,org/project/svglib), guaranteeing the highest resolution available.

For [example](https://github.com/ongyx/musdl/blob/master/Gymnop%C3%A9die_No_1.pdf), Gymnop√©die No. 1.

It is meant to be used as a command-line tool, but can also be imported and used as a module:

```python
from musdl import Score

my_score = Score(...)  # the Musescore url goes here
data = my_score.download("mp3")  # download as mp3, returns as bytes
```

## Why?
musdl was inspired by [musescore-downloader](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader), which is written in TypeScript. But, what if you wanted to run it without a web browser? That's why I made a Python equivalent.

## takedown request, et tu?
Take a look at this [issue](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5) in the same repo.

## Requirements
- `requests` - Downloader.
- `beautifulsoup4` - Powerful HTML parser.

For downloading PDFs:
- `reportlab` - Make PDFs.
- `svglib` - Convert SVGs into Reportlab drawings.

## Hacking

All my python projects now use [flit](https://pypi.org/project/flit) to build and publish.
So you need to `python3 -m pip install flit` first.

```
git clone https://github.com/onyxware/musdl
cd musdl
flit build
```

## Install
`(python3 -m) pip install musdl`

If you want to download PDFs, you need to install the `pdf` extra:

`(python3 -m) pip install musdl[pdf]`

## License
MIT.

## Known Issues
MXL download is broken (there is no direct url, like PDF).

## Changelog

### 2.3.0
Better PDF page detection (now the exact number of pages are known at runtime).
The attributes `.user`, `.id`, and `.pages` have been added to the `Score` class. (user and pages are self-explanatory, id is the score id.)
Added support for multi-threaded downloading of PDF pages (specify with `-t`). Downloading (may) be faster.

### 2.2.2
Fixed PDF scaling issue on Windows.

### 2.2.1
Made PDF downloading a extra feature (because `svglib` and `reportlab` dependencies are not pure-Python).

### 2.2.0
Fixed PDF support for Windows. Now musdl uses `svglib` as the backend for adding SVGs to PDFs.

### 2.1.1-2.1.2
Added PDF support.

### 2.0.0
Added `-O` option to use the score's title as the output filename (y'know, like `curl -O`).
Refactored code to be object-oriented, in the form of the `Score` class. This should make adding new features easier.
(Plus, you can use `musdl` more programmatically!)

### 1.1.2
Version bump, use Flit to build instead of `setup.py`.
Updated README too.

### 1.1.0
Added MusicXML download option, thanks to [JPFrancoia](https://github.com/JPFrancoia) for the update!

### 1.0.0
Initial version.
