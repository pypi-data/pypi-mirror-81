This provides a `cmlkit` interface to `qmmlpack`'s implementation of KRR. The `krr.py` module should be your starting point.

In essence, this implements a very standard approach to kernel ridge regression. The only point of possible confusion is that we separate `kernel` from `kernelf`, in analogy to a similar distinction in the `evaluation.loss` module. Here, we regard a `kernel` as something that produces a kernel matrix between entire systems (molecules or crystals). If we deal with global representations, the `kernel` is the same as a `kernelf`, but with local representations, we first compute the `kernelf` between *atoms* and then produce a global kernel between those "local" kernel matrices.

**Please note that [`qmmlpack`](https://gitlab.com/qmml/qmmlpack/-/tree/development) needs to be installed in order for this module to work. (On the develoment branch!)**
