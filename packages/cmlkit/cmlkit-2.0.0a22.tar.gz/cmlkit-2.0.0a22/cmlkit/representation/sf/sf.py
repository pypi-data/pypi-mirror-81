class SymmetryFunctions(Representation):
    """Atom-Centered Symmetry Functions.

    Symmetry functions are an atomic representation,
    consisting of an array of function values computed
    with different parametrisations.

    They were introduced by JÃ¶rg Behler in
    Behler, JCP 134, 074106 (2011).

    At the moment, we support only the "standard"
    angular and radial symmetry functions, which are:

    "rad": G_i^2 (eq. 6) in the paper.
    Parameters:
        cutoff: Maximum distance to central atom.
        eta: Width of the Gaussian.
        mu: Shift of center. (R_S in equation.)

    "ang": G_i^4 (eq. 8) in the paper.
    Parameters:
        cutoff: Maximum distance to central atom.
        eta: Width of Gaussian.
        zeta: Roughly, the width of the angular distribution.
        lambd: "Direction" of angular distribution. (Only +-1.)
            (note that `lambda` is a keyword, so it's lambd)

    For each of these, there is a "universal" version, which is applied
    to all element combinations with the same parameters, and a more
    specific "elemental" version, where the elements can be specified
    by hand. In the latter case, the additional parameters "z1", "z2"
    and for "ang" also "z3" with the atomic numbers need to be added.

    Typically, "universal" SFs are sufficient. Please note that elemental
    symmetry functions are currently not tested in this framework.

    Individual symmetry functions are specified in the default
    `cmlkit` config format, i.e. one radial symmetry function is

    `{"rad": {"cutoff": 1.0, "eta": 1.0, "mu": 0.0}}`.

    The elemental equivalent for "H" and "O" is:

    `{"rad": {"cutoff": 1.0, "eta": 1.0, "mu": 0.0, "z1": 1, "z2": 8}}`.

    ***

    Additionally, parametrization schemes are available for the radial
    universal symmetry functions.

    They are:
        "shifted": With arguments "cutoff" and "n", the n symmetry functions
            are distributed so their mean is on a regular grid between 0 and cutoff.
        "centered": Same as shifted, but all SFs are centered on 0, with
            widths on a grid up to the cutoff.

    Both schemes are also specified as configs, for instance:

    `{"shifted": {"n": 10, "cutoff": 3.0}}`

    (See `parametrization.py` for details.)

    Parametrisation schemes can be combined, and augmented with hand-defined SFs.

    ***

    Parameters:
        elems: List of elements for which SFs are supposed to be computed
        elemental: List of configs of elemental SFs
        universal: List of configs of universal SFs or configs of parametrization schemes
        dim: Dimensionality of resulting descriptor (will be inferred if None given)
