upgrade:
  - |
    A new CONFIG_KEYSTONE_FERNET_TOKEN_ROTATE_ENABLE option has been added to
    the answer file. When enabled (default), it will create a cron job to
    rotate Fernet keys.
deprecations:
  - |
    Since Keystone has deprecated token formats requiring storage in the DB,
    the CONFIG_KEYSTONE_DB_PURGE_ENABLE option has been removed. Instead, we
    are implementing a cron job to rotate Fernet keys.
