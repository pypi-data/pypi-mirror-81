Description: # Classification Library
        
        *A classification library using a [novel audio-inspired technique](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).*
        
        ## Installation
        
        Try:
        
        ```
        pip install classification_library
        ```
        
        Except:
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/lol-cubes/classification-library
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from classification_library import AudioClassifier
        import numpy as np
        
        
        X_train = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
        y_train = np.array([1, 4, 9, 16])
        X_test = np.array([5, 6])
        y_test = np.array([25, 36])
        
        
        model = AudioClassifier(alpha=10)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        correct_predictions = 0
        for y_true, y_pred in zip(y_test, predictions):
            if y_true == y_pred:
                correct_predictions += 1
        print(f"Accuracy: {correct_predictions / len(y_test)}")
        ```
