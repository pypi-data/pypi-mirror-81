Description: # Typed environment variables
        
        This module implements the mundane task of getting typed values from
         environment variables.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Assuming your environment has two variables set as follows (bash syntax):
        
            export FOO=123
            export BAR=y
        
        Then, you may access them in Python code as follows:
        
            import envil as env
        
            foo = env.get_int("FOO", 0)
            bar = env.get_bool("BAR", False)
        
        The set of strings considered to be falsy values for boolean variables are
        specified in `envil.FALSY_VALUES`:
        
            >>> print(repr(envil.FALSY_VALUES))
            {"0", "false", "f", "no", "n"}
        
        If needed you may override this list with your own, as in this example:
        
            bar = env.get_bool("BAR", falsy_strings={"nope", "zilch", "zero", "nada"})
        
        
        The second argument is the default value to be returned if the variable is not defined.
        If not specified, this argument will default to `envil.RAISE_EXCEPTION`, which will
        cause an `EnvironmentVariableNotSet` exception to be raised if the variable is not defined.
        
        Note that, unlike in Python's `getenv()`, you may specify `None` as a valid default value.
