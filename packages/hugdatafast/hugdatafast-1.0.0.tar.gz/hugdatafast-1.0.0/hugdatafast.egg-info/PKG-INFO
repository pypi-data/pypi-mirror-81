        # Install
        `pip install hugdatafast`
        
        # Furture Plan
        - I would like to merge this library to fastai and huggingface/datasets respectively. But I may have no time for it. You're welcome to pr this library to the two libraries.
        
        - The implemenatation of `CombineTransform` works but might be too complexed to extend, hope HuggingFace or someone come up with some great ideas.
        
        - Currently, it is designed to work with the dataset part of huggingface/datasets, I may also integrate the part of metric or not.
