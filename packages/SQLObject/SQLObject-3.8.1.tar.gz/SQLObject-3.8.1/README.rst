SQLObject 3.8.1
===============

Thanks for looking at SQLObject.  SQLObject is an object-relational
mapper, i.e., a library that will wrap your database tables in Python
classes, and your rows in Python instances.

It currently supports MySQL through the `MySQLdb` package, PostgreSQL
through the `psycopg` package, SQLite, Firebird, MaxDB (SAP DB), MS SQL,
and Sybase.  Python 2.7 or 3.4+ is required.

For more information please see the documentation in
`<docs/SQLObject.rst>`_, or online at http://sqlobject.org/
