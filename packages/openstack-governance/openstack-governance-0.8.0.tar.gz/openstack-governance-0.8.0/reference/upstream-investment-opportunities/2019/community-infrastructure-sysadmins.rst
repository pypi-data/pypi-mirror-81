==================================
Community Infrastructure Sysadmins
==================================

Summary
-------

The OpenStack community is seeking developers and system
administrators with a background in maintaining Unix/Linux servers and
free software to join the Infrastructure team.  This
team is responsible for designing, building and maintaining the
systems that are used in the day to day operation of the OpenStack
project as a whole.

Attrition due to shifts in employment or availability of personal time
impacts the team's ability to support the community effectively, and
so there is a constant need for new contributors who can commit to
investing sufficient effort to overcome the steep learning curve
associated with these varied technologies.

There is a particular need for infrastructure team members from APAC
and EMEA.

Business Case
-------------

Sponsorship of a team member is a way to visibly help build and
maintain the development, collaboration, and testing tools used by the
third most active open source project in the world without having to
donate hardware.  Team members interact with contributors across all
the OpenStack projects as well as with the OpenStack service providers
who supply resources for OpenStack CI systems.

Sponsors of infrastructure team members have a "seat at the table" as
decisions are made about how to improve and scale OpenStack
infrastructure going forwards.

Sponsors gain in-house expertise and experience building large-scale,
adaptive software development infrastructure with open-source tools
and public configuration management.  There is no better way to gain
exposure to and expertise with leading-edge CI/CD in advance of
potential deployment at home than to place someone on the team
deploying one of the world's most scaled out instances of the `Zuul
project`_.

The software developed, skills involved, and open community practices
learned can have high value downstream in a sponsors own enterprises
and software products.

Technical Details
-----------------

The infrastructure team is responsible for designing,
building and maintaining the systems that are used in the day to day
operation of the OpenStack project as a whole; this includes
development, testing, and collaboration tools. All of the software
it runs is open source, and under public configuration management so
that everyone in the community has the opportunity to participate.
One very effective way to get involved in OpenStack and gain a deep
understanding and visibility within the community is by helping
operate this infrastructure.

In particular, the team seeks developers and systems administrators
with a background both in maintaining Unix/Linux servers and free
software, and places heavy emphasis on systems automation and
configuration management (primarily Ansible and Puppet at the
moment). Everything possible goes through code review, and gets
extensively documented and communicated with the rest of the
community over IRC and mailing lists. Server resources are donated
by companies operating OpenStack services so there is
substantial opportunity both for people who have experience in those
technologies as well as anyone wishing to gain more familiarity with
them.

Value
~~~~~

The infrastructure team leverages resources donated from companies operating
OpenStack services. The community uses the software it produces as a tool for
testing it. Every day, contributors submit thousands of patches for review.
Infrastructure tools deploy each patch and test it against thousands of tests
and scenarios. This volume provides an opportunity to improve the software we
write by giving us first-hand experience with issues at scale. The benefit of
fixing these issues for the OpenStack CI system is two-fold:

1. It makes the test platform more stable and robust
2. Products or services benefits from the fix being applied upstream

Don't Repeat Yourself or Your Testing (DRY)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The culture built around extensive testing in OpenStack makes it easier for us
to trust patches proposed for review. We've integrated this culture into our
review process. Duplicating a social and technical CI system of this size takes
incredible amounts of time, people, and patience. Bolstering the CI system we
already have in place allows you to focus on testing that is specific to your
product or service.

Immediate Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack CI system is the backbone of feedback for contributors and
operators. Users get this feedback early, ideally before the patch lands.
Ensuring early feedback through a robust CI system and testing means fewer
surprises down the road when you attempt to integrate your product into a new
release or deploy a new version of a service.
