Description: 
        
        Fast Upfirdn
        ============
        The core low-level function implemented here is an equivalent of
        ``scipy.signal.upfirdn`` but with support for both CPU (via NumPy) and GPU
        (via CuPy).
        
        The version of ``upfirdn`` here supports several signal extension modes. These
        have been contributed upstream to SciPy and are available there for SciPy 1.4+.
