    The option to deploy nagios from packstack was
    deprecated in Ocata release and it has been removed
    in Pike. Following options have been retired:

      * CONFIG_NAGIOS_INSTALL
      * CONFIG_NAGIOS_PW

    Note that CentOS OpsTools Special Interest Group provides
    packages and automation tooling to deploy monitoring tools
    and integrate them with RDO.
