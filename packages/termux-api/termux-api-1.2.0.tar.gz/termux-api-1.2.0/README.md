termux-api is here, made with :heart:

## What is termux-api?
termux-api is a python module to access the [termux-api](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API)
This provides a way to get native access in Python to Android device functionality as API.

Most of the [termux-api implementations](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API) are directly available.
The API.generic() method gives direct access to any other method that has not yet been implemented.

## Special thanks
Thanks to termux and termux-api for making all this possible.
This module is heavily inspired by https://github.com/azwyane/pimux, though the code has been 
almost completely re-written and now is much more comprehensive.  
This project is originally located at [termux-api](https://github.com/shajul/termux-api)
