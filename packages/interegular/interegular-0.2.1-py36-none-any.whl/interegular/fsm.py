        A Finite State Machine or FSM has an alphabet and a set of states. At any
        given moment, the FSM is in one state. When passed a symbol from the
        alphabet, the FSM jumps to another state (or possibly the same state).
        A map (Python dictionary) indicates where to jump.
        One state is nominated as a starting state. Zero or more states are
        nominated as final states. If, after consuming a string of symbols,
        the FSM is in a final state, then it is said to "accept" the string.
        This class also has some pretty powerful methods which allow FSMs to
        be concatenated, alternated between, multiplied, looped (Kleene star
        closure), intersected, and simplified.
        The majority of these methods are available using operator overloads.
