    This function tries to tell if the node changes. This differs from the SCons
    function up_to_date/changed (which are optmized for the task logic) in two ways:
    1) It tries to find if something is different and exits as quick as possible.
        a. only expection at the moment is we do the children size check later.
    2) It check explict depend before calling scanners to get implicit depends

    This should avoid some unneed scans and checks when out of date.
    The logic also does this depth first. this is to ensure better
    environment state in cases of scanner calling builders.

    skip_implict - allows us to skip testing this nodes implict as we maybe testing
    this in the scanner for this node ( so the implicit are not known yet)
