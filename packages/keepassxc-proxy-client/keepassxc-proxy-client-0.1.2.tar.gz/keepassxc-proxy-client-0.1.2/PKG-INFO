Description: # keepassxc_proxy_client
        
        A small library as well as CLI tool to fetch information from a running keepassxc instance.
        
        ## CLI
        
        See `keepassxc_proxy_client --help` for usage.
        
        ## Library
        
        You can use it like this:
        ```python
        import keepassxc_proxy_client
        import keepassxc_proxy_client.protocol
        
        connection = keepassxc_proxy_client.protocol.Connection()
        connection.connect()
        print(connection.get_databasehash())
        # This will open a keepassxc dialogue
        print(connection.associate())
        print(connection.test_associate())
        print(connection.dump_associate())
        print(connection.get_logins("https://github.com"))
        ```
        
        If you want to dump and later read in the associate information you can do this
        as follows:
        
        ```python
        import keepassxc_proxy_client
        import keepassxc_proxy_client.protocol
        
        connection = keepassxc_proxy_client.protocol.Connection()
        connection.connect()
        name, public_key = connection.dump_associate()
        # save it and read it in again for later
        
        connection.load_associate(name, public_key)
        print(connection.test_associate())
        ```
        
        It is recommended to store the private key in a secure location since it basically acts
        as a key file to all your passwords that are associated with a URL, since get_logins() can only fetch
        passwords that are associated with one.
