Description: 
        Nutils is a Free and Open Source Python programming library for Finite Element
        Method computations, developed by `Evalf Computing <http://evalf.com>`_ and
        distributed under the permissive MIT license. Key features are a readable, math
        centric syntax, an object oriented design, strict separation of topology and
        geometry, and high level function manipulations with support for automatic
        differentiation.
        
        Nutils provides the tools required to construct a typical simulation workflow
        in just a few lines of Python code, while at the same time leaving full
        flexibility to build novel workflows or interact with third party tools. With
        native support for Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), the Finite Cell method (FCM),
        multi-physics, mixed methods, and hierarchical refinement, Nutils is at the
        forefront of numerical discretization science. Efficient under-the-hood
        vectorization and built-in parallellisation provide for an effortless
        transition from academic research projects to full scale, real world
        applications.
