class FailSafeVideo(Base):
  """A fail-safe video annotator.
  It tries several annotators in order and tries the next one if the previous
  one fails. However, the difference between this annotator and
  :any:`bob.bio.base.annotator.FailSafe` is that this one tries to use
  annotations from older frames (if valid) before trying the next annotator.

  .. warning::

      You must be careful in using this annotator since different annotators
      could have different results. For example the bounding box of one
      annotator be totally different from another annotator.

  Parameters
  ----------
  annotators : :any:`list`
      A list of annotators to try.
  max_age : int
      The maximum number of frames that an annotation is valid for next frames.
      This value should be positive. If you want to set max_age to infinite,
      then you can use the :any:`bob.bio.video.annotator.Wrapper` instead.
  validator : ``callable``
      A function that takes the annotations of a frame and validates it.


  Please see :any:`Base` for more accepted parameters.
