`adapter-transformers` is an extension of [HuggingFace's Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, integrating adapters into state-of-the-art language models by incorporating **[AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml)**, a central repository for pre-trained adapter modules.

This library can be used as a drop-in replacement for HuggingFace Transformers and regularly synchronizes new upstream changes.

## Installation

_adapter-transformers_ currently supports **Python 3.6+** and **PyTorch 1.1.0+**.
After [installing PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), you can install _adapter-transformers_ from PyPI ...

```
pip install -U adapter-transformers
```

... or from source by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git
cd adapter-transformers
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

HuggingFace's great documentation on getting started with _Transformers_ can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html). _adapter-transformers_ is fully compatible with _Transformers_.

To get started with adapters, refer to these locations:

- **https://docs.adapterhub.ml**, our documentation on training and using adapters with _adapter-transformers_
- **https://adapterhub.ml** to explore available pre-trained adapter modules and share your own adapters
- **[Examples folder](https://github.com/Adapter-Hub/adapter-transformers/tree/master/examples)** of this repository containing HuggingFace's example training scripts, many adapted for training adapters
