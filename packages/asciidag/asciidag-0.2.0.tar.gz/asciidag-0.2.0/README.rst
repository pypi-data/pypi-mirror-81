Overview
--------

This is a direct port of the `Git`_ log graphing code, which draws
directed acyclic commit graphs as ASCII art. It was done very
mechanically and quickly, so the code is not Pythonic. Dependencies on
`Git`_ specifics should be gone but look and feel remains.

This project is alpha quality and subject to breaking API changes.

    .. note::
       ðŸ’¡
       If you are thinking about doing a large refactoring, please submit
       an issue for discussion first; I consider it potentially worthwhile
       to stay close to the `Git`_ source.

Installation
------------

Available for install/upgrade from `PyPI`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U asciidag

As usual, it is best to install your packages into a `virtual environment`_.

Usage
-----

``examples/demo.py`` is included in the installation directory and is
executable. The core functionality is:

.. code:: python
   
       from asciidag.graph import Graph
       from asciidag.node import Node
   
       graph = Graph()
   
       root = Node('root')
       grandpa = Node('grandpa', parents=[root])
       tips = [
           Node('child', parents=[
               Node('mom', parents=[
                   Node('grandma', parents=[
                       Node('greatgrandma', parents=[]),
                   ]),
                   grandpa,
               ]),
               Node('dad', parents=[
                   Node('bill', parents=[
                       Node('martin'),
                       Node('james'),
                       Node('paul'),
                       Node('jon'),
                   ])]),
               Node('stepdad', parents=[grandpa]),
           ]),
           Node('foo', [Node('bar')]),
       ]
   
       graph.show_nodes(tips)
