Description: # PyGrids
        
        ## Description
        PyGrids is an module for storing and manipulating spreadsheet-like or grid-like information in python.
        It also uses numpy to speed up array operations.
        
        ## Example
        ```py
        from grids import Grid
        
        grid = Grid(5,3) # Create an empty 5x3 grid.
        
        print(grid.get_cell(5,3)) # -> ∅ None
        print(grid.get_cell(3,1)) # -> ∅ None
        
        grid.update_cell(5,3,'Foo')
        grid.update_cell(3,2,'Bar')
        
        print()
        print(grid.view())
        ```
        Will output...
        ```py
        ∅ 
        ∅
        
        ∅      ∅      ∅      ∅      ∅     
        ∅      ∅      'Bar'  ∅      ∅     
        ∅      ∅      ∅      ∅      'Foo' 
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        $ pip install pygrids
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Here's how you can use PyGrids.
        
        ### Using cells
        **Getting cells**
        ```py
        grid.get_cell(<x>, <y>)
        ```
        
        **Updating cells**
        ```py
        grid.update_cell(<x>, <y>, <new_value>)
        ```
        
        **Overviewing cells**
        ```py
        print(grid.view())
        ```
        
        **Iterating through cells**
        > By Columns
        ```py
        for column in grid.y_by_x():
            for cell in column:
                print(x)
        ```
        > By Rows
        ```py
        for row in grid.x_by_y():
            for cell in row:
                print(y)
        ```
        
        ### Saving `Grid`s
        You can save your grids by using their built-in ``save()`` method.
        ```py
        # Saves by default to grid1.dat or grid2.dat if that's taken or grid3.dat if grid2.dat it taken, etc.
        grid.save()
        # Or you can specify a specify a specific filename
        grid.save(filename='mygrid.dat')
        ```
        
        ### Loading `Grid`s from file
        You can also load your grids into python by using `Grid`'s static ``load()`` method like so.
        ```py
        grid = Grid.load('mygrid.dat')
        ```
