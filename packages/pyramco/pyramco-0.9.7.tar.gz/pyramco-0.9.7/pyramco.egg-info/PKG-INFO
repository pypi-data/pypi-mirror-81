Description: # pyramco
        A complete Python wrapper class for the RAMCO API
        
        
        version 0.9.7
        10-3-2020
        
        
        Notes for 0.9.7 release:
        
        - Attributes and Attribute Values arguments now accept lists and dicts, respectively, and no longer accept formatted strings. THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE. Use version <= 0.9.69 for backward compatibility. 
        - Strings passed to Attributes and Attribute Values arguments are now sanitized of literal "#" characters, which are detected and base64 encoded properly for CRM. (You may still override the default string delimiter in the usual manner)
        - API key will be detected as an environment variable OR in a config file, OR can be passed as an argument 'ramco_api_key'.
        - Added a new error message/code for missing API key.
