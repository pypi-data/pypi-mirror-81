class Consumer(object):
    """A simple Kafka consumer implementation

    This consumer consumes a single partition from a single topic, optionally
    automatically committing offsets.  Use it as follows:

    - Create an instance of :class:`afkak.KafkaClient` with cluster
      connectivity details.
    - Create the :class:`Consumer`, supplying the client, topic, partition,
      processor function, and optionally fetch specifics, a consumer group,
      and a commit policy.
    - Call :meth:`.start` with the offset within the partition at which to
      start consuming messages. See :meth:`.start` for details.
    - Process the messages in your :attr:`.processor` callback, returning a
      :class:`~twisted.internet.defer.Deferred` to provide backpressure as
      needed.
    - Once processing resolves, :attr:`.processor` will be called again with
      the next batch of messages.
    - When desired, call :meth:`.shutdown` on the :class:`Consumer` to halt
      calls to the :attr:`processor` function and commit progress (if
      a *consumer_group* is specified).

    A :class:`Consumer` may be restarted once stopped.

    :ivar client:
        Connected :class:`KafkaClient` for submitting requests to the Kafka
        cluster.
    :ivar str topic:
        The topic from which to consume messages.
    :ivar int partition:
        The partition from which to consume.
    :ivar callable processor:
        The callback function to which the consumer and lists of messages
        (:class:`afkak.common.SourcedMessage`) will be submitted
        for processing.  The function may return
        a :class:`~twisted.internet.defer.Deferred` and will not be called
        again until this Deferred resolves.
    :ivar str consumer_group:
        Optional consumer group ID for committing offsets of processed
        messages back to Kafka.
    :ivar bytes commit_metadata:
        Optional metadata to store with offsets commit.
    :ivar int auto_commit_every_n:
        Number of messages after which the consumer will automatically
        commit the offset of the last processed message to Kafka. Zero
        disables, defaulted to :data:`AUTO_COMMIT_MSG_COUNT`.
    :ivar int auto_commit_every_ms:
        Time interval in milliseconds after which the consumer will
        automatically commit the offset of the last processed message to
        Kafka. Zero disables, defaulted to :data:`AUTO_COMMIT_INTERVAL`.
    :ivar int fetch_size_bytes:
        Number of bytes to request in a :class:`FetchRequest`.  Kafka will
        defer fulfilling the request until at least this many bytes can be
        returned.
    :ivar int fetch_max_wait_time:
        Max number of milliseconds the server should wait for that many
        bytes.
    :ivar int buffer_size:
        default 128K. Initial number of bytes to tell Kafka we have
        available. This will be raised x16 up to 1MB then double up to...
    :ivar int max_buffer_size:
        Max number of bytes to tell Kafka we have available.  `None` means
        no limit (the default). Must be larger than the largest message we
        will find in our topic/partitions.
    :ivar float request_retry_init_delay:
        Number of seconds to wait before retrying a failed request to
        Kafka.
    :ivar float request_retry_max_delay:
        Maximum number of seconds to wait before retrying a failed request
        to Kafka (the delay is increased on each failure and reset to the
        initial delay upon success).
    :ivar int request_retry_max_attempts:
        Maximum number of attempts to make for any request. Default of zero
        means retry forever; other values must be positive and indicate
        the number of attempts to make before returning failure.


    :ivar int auto_offset_reset:
        What action should be taken when the broker responds to a fetch request
        with `OffsetOutOfRangeError`?

        - `OFFSET_EARLIEST`: request the oldest available messages. The
          consumer will read every message in the topic.
        - `OFFSET_LATEST`: request the most recent messages (this is the Java
          consumer's default). The consumer will read messages once new
          messages are produced to the topic.
        - `None`: fail on `OffsetOutOfRangeError` (Afkak's default). The
          `Deferred` returned by :meth:`Consumer.start()` will errback. The
          caller may call :meth:`~.start()` again with the desired offset.

        The broker returns `OffsetOutOfRangeError` when the client requests an
        offset that isn't valid. This may mean that the requested offset no
        longer exists, e.g. if it was removed due to age.
