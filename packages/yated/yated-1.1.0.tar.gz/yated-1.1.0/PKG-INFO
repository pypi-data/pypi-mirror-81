Description: # Yet Another Text EDitor
        
        This is a terminal based text editor, inspired by a wish to have 
        an editor with default visual and key bindings that resemble typical
        GUI based editors.
        
        Written in Python and relying on the curses module, support for various
        key combinations varies with system and terminal.
        
        So far, best results are seen in the _gnome-terminal_
        
        Depends on either xclip or python3-pyqt4 for clipboard operations
        
        Install with apt:
        
            sudo apt install python3 python3-pip xclip
            sudo pip3 install yated
        
        
        Main features:
        
        * Simple arrow based navigation
        * Ctrl-left/right for next prev word
        * Text selection with shifted arrows
        * Block indentation with tab
        * Block C/C++ comment with //
        * Menu to help find commands / options
        * Simple macro recording
        * Text search with case/whole word/regex support
        * Fast.  Loading 100Mb file takes about 1 second, compared to 40 seconds on gedit
        * For simplicity, tabs are replaced by spaces (size configurable)
