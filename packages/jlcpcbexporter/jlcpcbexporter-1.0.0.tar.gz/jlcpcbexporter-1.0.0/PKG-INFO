        # `jlcpcbexporter`
        
        Tool to generate BOM and CPL files compatible with JLCPCB's SMT process.
        
        This tool takes an EAGLE CAM export zip file, and generates comma-separated
        values (CSV) files that can be uploaded to JLCPCB's web interface to request
        SMT treatment for a board.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        $ pip install jlcbpcexporter
        $ jlcpcbexporter --layer top eagle-cam-export.zip
        ```
        
        The `--layer` flag selects between `top` and `bottom` layer, as JLCPCB only
        allows SMT on one of the two.
        
        ## Compatibility
        
        The tool has been developed with Python 3.8 on Windows, but it should be
        compatible with any reasonably modern Python on any operating system.
