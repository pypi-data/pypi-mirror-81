### Create GitHub Personal Access Token:

The CLI requires GitHub Personal Access Token to make requests to the GitHub API.

> Get [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

You don't have to select any scopes, add a Note for your token and select _Generate token_.

**Provide token to CLI:**

```bash
gfi config
```

Token is stored locally on `/home/<username>/.gfi/good-first-issues` file.

## Usage

GitHub provides API using both REST and GraphQL, each with 5000 requests per hour with the Personal Access Token.

You can switch between these APIs but **using the GraphQL option is faster and efficient!**

There are two ways you can get good first issues:

1. query all the repos in a user or an organization profile.
2. query a particular repo in a user or an organization profile.

### **GraphQL**

To use the GraphQL option use the `gfi gql` command.

**Query all the repos in a user or an organization profile.**

```bash
  # Query all repos in an organization
  gfi gql "rust-lang"

  # Query all repos in a user profile
  gfi gql "sindresorhus" --user
```

**Query a particular repo in a user or an organization profile.**

```bash
  # Query a single repo in an organization
  gfi gql "rust-lang" --repo "rust"

  # Query a single repo in a user profile
  # No --user flag needed.
  gfi gql "sindresorhus" --repo "awesome"
```

**Changing output limits**

The output is limited to display 10 issues by default. Use `--limit` flag to set the number of issues for output or `--all` for no limits.

```bash
  # Limit the issues to 20
  gfi gql "rust-lang" --limit 20

  # View all issues found.
  gfi gql "rust-lang" --all

```

**Viewing issues on browser**

It's hard to navigate through all the issues when you have the `--all` flag enabled, you can view the issues on your browser with ease using the `--web` flag.

```bash
gfi gql "rust-lang" --all --web
```

---

### **REST API**

To use the GraphQL option use the `gfi get` command.

**Query all the repos in a user or an organization profile.**

```bash
  # Query all repos in an organization
  gfi get "rust-lang"

  # Query all repos in a user profile
  gfi get "sindresorhus"
```

**Changing output limits**

The output is limited to display 10 issues by default. Use `--limit` flag to set the number of issues for output or `--all` for no limits.

```bash
  # Limit the issues to 20
  gfi get "rust-lang" --limit 20

  # View all issues found.
  gfi get "rust-lang" --all

```

**Viewing issues on browser**

It's hard to navigate through all the issues when you have the `--all` flag enabled, you can view the issues on your browser with ease using the `--web` flag.

```bash
gfi gql "rust-lang" --all --web
```
