        ### What's in the box?
        
        **gospl** (pronounced: /ˈɡospel/, [ˈɡo̞s̠pe̞l]) is a scalable parallelised Python-based numerical model built to simulate paleo-landscapes and basins reconstruction at global scale.
        
        
        The model accounts for hillslope processes (soil creep using linear diffusion), fluvial incision (stream power law), spatially and temporally varying tectonics (horizontal and vertical displacements) and climatic forces (temporal and spatial precipitation changes and/or sea-level fluctuations).
        
        
        ### Specs
        
        
        The model is based on the following approaches:
        
        + an adaptation of the implicit, parallelisable method for calculating drainage area for both single (D8) and multiple flow direction (Dinf) from [Richardson et al., 2014],
        + the methods developed in _badlands_ [Salles et al., 2018] for marine sediment distribution,
        + a _PETSc_ layer similar to the one in _eSCAPE_ [Salles, 2019] for mesh partitioning and solvers.
